      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier

# **SPLUNK GENERAL TERMS**

Last Updated: February 10, 2023

These Splunk General Terms (&quot;General Terms&quot;) between Splunk Inc., a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business at 270 Brannan Street, San Francisco, California 94107, U.S.A (&quot;Splunk&quot; or &quot;we&quot; or &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) and you (&quot;Customer&quot; or &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) apply to the purchase of licenses and subscriptions for Splunk’s Offerings. By clicking on the appropriate button, or by downloading, installing, accessing or using the Offerings, you agree to these General Terms. If you are entering into these General Terms on behalf of Customer, you represent that you have the authority to bind Customer. If you do not agree to these General Terms, or if you are not authorized to accept the General Terms on behalf of the Customer, do not download, install, access, or use any of the Offerings.

**See the General Terms Definitions Exhibit attached for definitions of capitalized terms not defined herein.**

#### **1. License Rights**

A. **General Rights.** You have the nonexclusive, worldwide, nontransferable and nonsublicensable right, subject to payment of applicable Fees and compliance with the terms of these General Terms, to use your Purchased Offerings for your Internal Business Purposes during the Term and up to the Capacity purchased.

B. **Copies for On-Premise Products.** You have the right to make a reasonable number of copies of On-Premises Products for archival and back-up purposes.

C. **Splunk Extensions.** You may use Splunk Extensions solely in connection with the applicable Purchased Offering subject to the same terms and conditions for that Offering (including with respect to Term) and payment of any Fees associated with the Splunk Extensions. Some Splunk Extensions may be made available under license terms that provide broader rights than the license rights you have to the applicable underlying Offering (e.g., if the Extension is Open Source Software). These broader rights will apply to that Splunk Extension. Splunk Extensions may be installed on Hosted Services pursuant to our instructions.

D. **Trials, Evaluations, Beta and Free Licenses.**

<ol type="i">
  <li><b>Trials and Evaluations.</b> Offerings provided for trials and evaluations are provided at no charge, and their use will be for a limited duration.</li>
  <li><b>Beta Licenses.</b> Some Offerings and features may be available to you as a preview, or as an alpha, beta or other pre-release version (each, a "<b>Beta Offering</b>"). All rights for Beta Offerings are solely for internal testing and evaluation. Your use of a Beta Offering will be for the term specified by us, and if no term is specified, then for the earlier of one year from the start date of the Beta Offering or when that version of the Beta Offering becomes generally available. We may discontinue the Beta Offering at any time and may decide not to make any of the features and functionality generally available.</li>
  <li><b>Free Licenses.</b> From time to time, we may make certain Offerings available for full use (i.e., not subject to limited evaluation purposes) at no charge. These free Offerings may have limited features, functions, and other technical limitations.</li>
  <li><b>Donated Offerings.</b> Donated Offerings are free limited Offerings donated to qualifying Nonprofits under a Splunk donation program. By procuring and making use of a Donated Offering, you hereby represent and warrant that you are a lawfully organized Nonprofit, and you agree to provide verification of your nonprofit status to Splunk upon request. At Splunk’s request, you agree: (a) to publish a press release and case study on your use of the Donated Offering; and (b) to be interviewed for the production of a Splunk customer video that will accompany the press release and case study. Splunk will draft and edit all content in collaboration with you and will obtain your edits and written approval (email is sufficient) prior to publication, and such approval will not be unreasonably withheld. You will allow Splunk to reference your Nonprofit and leading spokespeople in press releases with your written approval (email is sufficient). Splunk may use your name and logo on sales presentations, websites, and other marketing collateral without your prior approval.</li>
 <li><b>Test and Development Licenses.</b> For Offerings identified as "<b>Test and Development</b>" Offerings on your Order, you only have the right to use those Offerings up to the applicable Capacity on a non-production system for non-production uses, including product migration testing or pre-production staging, or testing new data sources, types, or use cases. Test and Development Offerings may not be used for any revenue generation, commercial activity, or other productive business or purpose.</li>
<li><b>Limitations.</b> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these General Terms, we do not provide maintenance and support, warranties, service level commitments, or indemnification for Test and Development Offerings, trials, evaluations, or free or Beta Offerings.</li>
</ol>

#### **2. Purchasing Through Authorized Resellers, Digital Marketplaces, and Splunk Affiliates**

A. **Authorized Resellers and Digital Marketplaces.** If you purchase Offerings through a Splunk authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, these General Terms will govern those Offerings. Your payment obligations for the Purchased Offerings will be with the authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, as applicable, not Splunk. You will have no direct Fee payment obligations to Splunk for those Offerings. However, in the event that you fail to pay the Digital Marketplace for your Purchased Offerings, Splunk retains the right to enforce your payment obligations and collect directly from you.

Any terms agreed to between you and the authorized reseller that are in addition to these General Terms are solely between you and the authorized reseller and Digital Marketplace, as applicable. No agreement between you and an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace is binding on Splunk or will have any force or effect with respect to the rights in, or the operation, use or provision of, the Offerings.

B. **Splunk Affiliate Distributors.** Splunk has appointed certain Splunk Affiliates as its non-exclusive distributors of the Offerings (each, a &quot;**Splunk Affiliate Distributor**&quot;). Each Splunk Affiliate Distributor is authorized by Splunk to negotiate and enter into Orders with Customers. Where a purchase from Splunk is offered by a Splunk Affiliate Distributor, Customer will issue Orders, and make payments, to the Splunk Affiliate Distributor which issued the quote for the Offering. Each Order will be deemed a separate contract between Customer and the relevant Splunk Affiliate Distributor and will be subject to these General Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer agrees that: (i) the total liability of Splunk under these General Terms as set forth in Section 22 (Limitation of Liability) states the overall combined liability of Splunk and Splunk Affiliate Distributors; (ii) the entering into Orders by a Splunk Affiliate Distributor will not be deemed to expand Splunk and its Affiliates’ overall responsibilities or liability under these General Terms; and (iii) Customer will have no right to recover more than once from the same event.

#### **3. Your Contractors and Third-Party Providers**

You may permit your authorized consultants, contractors, and agents (&quot;**Third-Party Providers**&quot;) to access and use your Purchased Offerings, but only on your behalf in connection with providing services to you, and subject to the terms and conditions of these General Terms. Any access or use by a Third-Party Provider will be subject to the same limitations and restrictions that apply to you under these General Terms, and you will be responsible for any Third-Party Provider’s actions relating to their use of the Offering. The aggregate use by you and all of your Third-Party Providers must not exceed the Capacity purchased, and nothing in this Section is intended to or will be deemed to increase such Capacity.

#### **4. Hosted Services and Specific Offering Terms**

A. **Service Levels.** When you purchase Hosted Services as a Purchased Offering, we will make the applicable Hosted Services available to you during the Term in accordance with these General Terms. The Service Level Schedules (as identified in the Specific Offering Terms referenced in Section 4(F) below) and associated remedies will apply to the availability and uptime of the applicable Hosted Service. If applicable, service credits will be available for downtime in accordance with the Service Level Schedule.

B. **Connections.** You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all telecommunications, broadband and computer equipment and services needed to access and use Hosted Services, and for paying all associated charges.

C. **Your Responsibility for Data Protection.** You are responsible for: (i) selecting from the security configurations and security options made available by Splunk in connection with a Hosted Service; (ii) taking additional measures outside of the Hosted Service to the extent the Hosted Service Offering does not provide the controls that may be required or desired by you; and (iii) routine archiving and backing up of Customer Content. You agree to notify Splunk promptly if you believe that an unauthorized third party may be using your accounts or if your account information is lost or stolen.

D. **Refund Upon Termination for Splunk’s Breach.** If a Hosted Service is terminated by you for Splunk’s uncured material breach in accordance with these General Terms, Splunk will refund you any prepaid subscription fees covering the remainder of the Term after the effective date of termination.

E. **Return of Customer Content.** Customer Content may be retrieved by you and removed from the Hosted Services in accordance with the applicable Documentation. We will make the Customer Content available on the Hosted Services for thirty (30) days after termination of a subscription for your retrieval. After that thirty (30) day period, we will have no obligation to maintain the storage of your Customer Content, and you hereby authorize us thereafter to, and we will, unless legally prohibited, delete all remaining Customer Content. If you require assistance in connection with migration of your Customer Content, depending on the nature of the request, we may require a mutually agreed upon fee for assistance.

F. **Specific Offering Terms.** Specific security controls and certifications, data policies, service descriptions, Service Level Schedules and other terms specific to a Hosted Service and other Offerings (&quot;**Specific Offering Terms**&quot;) are set forth here: [www.splunk.com/SpecificTerms](www.splunk.com/SpecificTerms), and will apply, and be deemed incorporated herein by reference.

#### **5. Support and Maintenance**

The specific Support Program included with a Purchased Offering will be identified in the applicable Order. Splunk will provide the purchased level of support and maintenance services in accordance with the terms of the Support Exhibit attached to these General Terms.

#### **6. Configuration and Implementation Services**

Splunk offers standard services to implement and configure your Purchased Offerings. These services are purchased under an Order and are subject to the payment of the Fees therein and the terms of the Configuration and Implementation Services Exhibit attached to these General Terms.

#### **7. Data Protection for Personal Data**

Splunk will follow globally recognized data protection principles and industry-leading standards for the security of personal data. Splunk will comply with the requirements and obligations set forth in Splunk’s Data Processing Addendum (&quot;**DPA**&quot;), located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-dpa.html, which includes standard terms for the processing of personal data (including, as applicable, personal data in a Hosted Service).

#### **8. Security**

A. **Security for Hosted Services: Standard Environment.** Splunk will implement industry leading security safeguards for the protection of Customer Confidential Information, including Customer Content transferred to and stored within the Hosted Services. These safeguards include commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect Customer Content against destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or unauthorized access, including such things as information security policies and procedures, security awareness training, threat and vulnerability management, incident response and breach notification, and vendor risk management. Splunk’s technical safeguards are further described in the Splunk Cloud Platform Security Addendum (&quot;**SC-SA**&quot;), located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-cloud-security-addendum.html, and the Observability Suite Security Addendum (&quot;**OS-SA**&quot;), located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-observability-security-addendum.html, as applicable, and are incorporated herein by reference. Splunk may update the SC-SA and OS-SA from time to time provided, that updates will be subject to Section 24 below.

B. **Security for Hosted Services: Premium HIPAA Environment.** For Hosted Services Offerings provisioned in Splunk Cloud Platform’s Premium HIPAA environment (as specified in an Order), in addition to the protections under the SC-SA and these General Terms, Splunk will comply with the requirements and obligations set forth in Splunk Business Associate Agreement found here: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-baa.html.

C. **Additional Security for Other Hosted Services.** From time to time, Splunk may offer custom security safeguards for unique Hosted Services offerings. Any such security safeguards will be as set forth in the applicable Documentation and Specific Offering Terms.

D. **Security for On Premises Offerings.** Splunk will implement industry leading security safeguards for the protection of Splunk’s IT systems, products, facilities and assets, and any Customer Confidential Information accessed or processed therein, e.g., customer account information, support tickets (&quot;**Corporate Security Controls**&quot;). Splunk’s Corporate Security Controls include such things as information security policies and procedures, security awareness training, physical and environmental access controls, threat and vulnerability management, incident response and breach notification, and vendor risk management. Splunk’s Corporate Security Controls are further described in Splunk’s Information Security Addendum (&quot;**ISA**&quot;), located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/information-security-addendum.html and are incorporated herein by reference.

E. **Product Development Security.** Splunk will follow secure software development practices and applies an industry standard, risk-based approach to its software development lifecycle (&quot;**SDLC**&quot;), which includes, as applicable, such things as performing security architecture reviews, open source security scans, virus detection, dynamic application security testing, network vulnerability scans and external penetration testing in the development environment. Product-specific information about the SDLC in our Offerings is detailed more fully in the ISA. Splunk’s Product Security Portal, located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/product-security.html, contains detailed information about Splunk’s program for managing and communicating product vulnerabilities. Splunk categorizes product vulnerabilities in accordance with the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (&quot;Medium,&quot; &quot;High,&quot; or &quot;Critical&quot;) and uses commercially reasonable efforts to remediate vulnerabilities depending on their severity level in accordance with industry standards.

F. **Maintaining Protections.** Notwithstanding anything to contrary in these General Terms, or any policy or terms referenced herein via hyperlink (or any update thereto), Splunk may not, during a Term materially diminish the security protections set forth in these General Terms, any Specific Offering Terms, or the applicable security addendum.

#### **9. Use Restrictions**

Except as expressly permitted in an Order, these General Terms or our Documentation, you agree not to (nor allow any user or Third Party Provider to): (a) reverse engineer (except to the extent specifically permitted by statutory law), decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover source code or underlying structures, ideas or algorithms of any Offering; (b) modify, translate or create derivative works based on the Offerings; (c) use an Offering to ingest, monitor or analyze the machine, IT system or application data of any third party; (d) resell, transfer or distribute any Offering; (e) access or use any Offering in order to monitor its availability, performance, or functionality for competitive purposes; (f) attempt to disable or circumvent any license key or other technological mechanisms or measures intended to prevent, limit or control use or copying of, or access to, Offerings; (g) separately use any of the applicable features and functionalities of the Offerings with external applications or code not furnished by Splunk or any data not processed by the Offering; (h) exceed the Capacity purchased or (i) use any Offering in violation of all applicable laws and regulations (including but not limited to any applicable privacy and intellectual property laws).

#### **10. Our Ethics, Compliance and Corporate Responsibility**

A. **Ethics and Corporate Responsibility.** Splunk is committed to acting ethically and in compliance with applicable law, and we have policies and guidelines in place to provide awareness of, and compliance with, the laws and regulations that apply to our business globally. We are committed to ethical business conduct, and we use diligent efforts to perform in accordance with the highest global ethical principles, as described in the Splunk Code of Conduct and Ethics found [here](https://investors.splunk.com/static-files/3c2a9a40-7f6e-4795-9358-b5565826b13d?_ga=2.27382325.82146825.1675981089-269939538.1673288458&_gac=1.127441023.1674005341.Cj0KCQiAq5meBhCyARIsAJrtdr75-RptXmmxNnKzoOJ_p26uX0MwT-GzxcrmWSotrQqWFlaOLtYVyhgaAuriEALw_wcB&_gl=1*1xgvjcs*_ga*MjY5OTM5NTM4LjE2NzMyODg0NTg.*_ga_5EPM2P39FV*MTY3NjA1MTkwNi40OC4xLjE2NzYwNjAxMzMuMzYuMC4w).

B. **Anti-Corruption.** We implement and maintain programs for compliance with applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. Splunk policy prohibits the offering or soliciting of any illegal or improper bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value to or from any of your employees or agents in connection with these General Terms. If we learn of any violation of the above, we will use reasonable efforts to promptly notify you at the main contact address provided by you to Splunk.

C. **Export.** We certify that Splunk is not on any of the relevant U.S. or EU government lists of prohibited persons, including the Treasury Department’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and the Commerce Department’s List of Denied Persons or Entity List. Export information regarding our Offerings, including our export control classifications for our Offerings, is found here: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/export-controls.html.

#### **11. Usage Data**

From time to time, Splunk may collect Usage Data generated as a by-product of your use of Offerings. Usage Data does not include Customer Content. We collect Usage Data for a variety of reasons, such as to identify, understand, and anticipate performance issues and the factors that affect them, to provide updates and personalized experiences to customers, and to improve the Splunk Offerings. Details on Splunk’s Usage Data collection practices are set forth in Splunk's Privacy Policy found here: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/privacy/privacy-policy.html.

#### **12. Capacity and Usage Verification**

A. **Certification and Verification.** At Splunk’s request, you will furnish Splunk a certification signed by your authorized representative verifying that your use of the Purchased Offering is in accordance with these General Terms and the applicable Order. For On-Premises Products, we may also ask you from time to time, but not more frequently than once per calendar period, to cooperate with us to verify usage and adherence to purchased Capacities. If Splunk requests a verification process, you agree to provide Splunk reasonable access to the On-Premises Product installed at your facility (or as hosted by your Third-Party Provider). If Splunk does any verification, it will be performed with as little interference as possible to your use of the On-Premises Product and your business operations. Splunk will comply with your (or your Third-Party Providers’) reasonable security procedures.

B. **Overages.** If a verification or usage report reveals that you have exceeded the purchased Capacity or usage rights for your Purchased Offering (e.g., used as a service bureau) during the period reviewed, then we will have the right to invoice you using the applicable Fees at list price then in effect, which will be payable in accordance with these General Terms. Without limiting Splunk’s foregoing rights, with respect to Hosted Services, Splunk may work with you to reduce usage so that it conforms to the applicable usage limit, and we will in good faith discuss options to right size your subscription as appropriate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Splunk will have the right to directly invoice you for overages, regardless of whether you purchased the Purchased Offering from an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace. See the Specific Offering Terms for any additional information related to overages for a Hosted Service.

#### **13. Our Use of Open Source**

Certain Offerings may contain Open Source Software. Splunk makes available in the applicable Documentation a list of Open Source Software incorporated in our On-Premises Products as required by the respective Open Source Software licenses. Any Open Source Software that is delivered as part of your Offering and which may not be removed or used separately from the Offering is covered by the warranty, support and indemnification provisions applicable to the Offering. Some of the Open Source Software may have additional terms that apply to the use of the Offering (e.g., the obligation for us to provide attribution of the specific licensor), and those terms will be included in the Documentation; however, these terms will not (a) impose any additional restrictions on your use of the Offering, or (b) negate or amend any of our responsibilities with respect to the Offering.

#### **14. Splunk Developer Tools and Customer Extensions**

Splunk makes Splunk Developer Tools available to you so you can develop Extensions for use with your Purchased Offerings (Extensions that you develop, &quot;**Customer Extensions**&quot;).

You have a nonexclusive, worldwide, nontransferable, nonsublicensable right, subject to the terms of these General Terms, to use Splunk Developer Tools to develop your Customer Extensions, including to support interoperability between the Offering and your system or environment. Splunk proprietary legends or notices contained in the Splunk Developer Tools may not be removed or altered when used in or with your Customer Extension. You retain title to your Customer Extensions, subject to Splunk’s ownership in our Offerings and any materials and technology provided by Splunk in connection with the Splunk Developer Tools. You agree to assume full responsibility for the performance and distribution of Customer Extensions.

#### **15. Third Party Products, Third-Party Extensions, Third-Party Content and Unsupported Splunk Extensions**

A. **Third-Party Extensions on Splunkbase.** Splunk makes Extensions developed and/or made available by a third-party on Splunkbase (&quot;**Third-Party Extension**&quot;) available for download or access as a convenience to its customers. Splunk makes no promises or guarantees related to any Third-Party Extension, including the accuracy, integrity, quality, or security of the Third-Party Extension. Nothing in these General Terms or on Splunkbase will be deemed to be a representation or warranty by Splunk with respect to any Third-Party Extension, even if a particular Third-Party Extension is identified as &quot;certified&quot; or &quot;validated&quot; for use with an Offering. We may, in our reasonable discretion, block or disable access to any Third-Party Extension at any time. Your use of a Third-Party Extension is at your own risk and may be subject to any additional terms, conditions, and policies applicable to that Third-Party Extension (such as license terms, terms of service, or privacy policies of the providers of such Third-Party Extension). Third-Party Extensions may be installed on Hosted Services pursuant to our instructions.

B. **Third Party Content.** Hosted Services may contain features or functions that enable interoperation with Third-Party Content that you, in your sole discretion, choose to add to a Hosted Service. You may be required to obtain access separately to such Third-Party Content from the respective providers, and you may be required to grant Splunk access to your accounts with such providers to the extent necessary for Splunk to allow the interoperation with the Hosted Service. By requesting or allowing Splunk to enable access to such Third-Party Content in connection with the Hosted Services, you certify that you are authorized under the provider’s terms to allow such access. If you install or enable (or direct or otherwise authorize Splunk to install or enable) Third-Party Content for use with a Hosted Service where the interoperation includes access by the third-party provider to your Customer Content, you hereby authorize Splunk to allow the provider of such Third-Party Content to access Customer Content as necessary for the interoperation. You agree that Splunk is not responsible or liable for disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Content resulting from access to Customer Content by such Third-Party Content, nor is Splunk liable for any damages or downtime that you may incur or any impact on your experience of the Hosted Service, directly or indirectly, as a result of your use of and/or reliance upon, any Third-Party Content, sites or resources.

C. **Splunk As a Reseller.** When you purchase third party products (&quot;**Third Party Products**&quot;) from Splunk as specified in an Order (which products shall include third party software, but not any support which Splunk itself has contracted to provide), the following provision applies. Splunk acts solely as a reseller of Third Party Products, which are fulfilled by the relevant third party vendor (&quot;**Third Party Vendor**&quot;), and the purchase and use of Third Party Products is subject solely to the terms, conditions and policies made available by such Third Party Vendor. Consequently, Splunk makes no representation or warranty of any kind regarding the Third Party Products, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, and specifically disclaims all implied terms, conditions and warranties (including as to quality, performance, availability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. You will bring any claim in relation to Third Party Products against the applicable Third Party Vendor directly. In no event will Splunk be liable to you for any claim, loss or damage arising out of the use, operation or availability of Third Party Product (whether such liability arises in contract, negligence, tort, or otherwise).

D. **Unsupported Splunk Extensions.** The Service Level Schedule commitments for any applicable Hosted Services will not apply to Splunk Extensions labeled on Splunkbase as &quot;**Not Supported.**&quot; You agree that Splunk is not responsible for any impact on your experience of a Hosted Service, as a result of your installation and/or use of any &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extensions, and that your sole remedy will be to remove the &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extension from the applicable Hosted Service. Further, some Splunk Extensions may not be compatible or certified for use with that Hosted Service (e.g., only specific Splunk Extensions are validated for our FedRAMP authorized environment for Splunk Cloud Platform). Please refer to the applicable Documentation for more information related to the Splunk Extensions compatible with your specific Purchased Offering.

#### **16. Your Compliance**

A. **Lawful Use of Offerings.** When you access and use an Offering, you are responsible for complying with all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to your access and use. This includes being responsible for your Customer Content and users, for your users’ compliance with these General Terms, and the accuracy, lawful use of, and the means by which you acquired your Customer Content. You may not transmit and/or store PHI Data, PCI Data or ITAR Data within a Hosted Services unless you have specifically purchased a Purchased Offering for that applicable regulated Hosted Services environment (as identified in an Order).

B. **Registration.** You agree to provide accurate and complete information when you register for and use any Offering and agree to keep this information current. Each person who uses any Offering must have a separate username and password. For Hosted Services, you must provide a valid email address for each person authorized to use your Hosted Services, and you may only have one person per username and password. Splunk may reasonably require additional information in connection with certain Offerings (e.g., technical information necessary for your connection to a Hosted Service), and you will provide this information as reasonably requested by Splunk. You are responsible for securing, protecting, and maintaining the confidentiality of your account usernames, passwords and access tokens.

C. **Export Compliance.** You will comply with all applicable export laws and regulations of the United States and any other country (&quot;Export Laws&quot;) where your users use any of the Offerings. You certify that you are not on any of the relevant U.S. government lists of prohibited persons, including the Treasury Department’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and the Commerce Department’s List of Denied Persons or Entity List. You will not export, re-export, ship, transfer or otherwise use the Offerings in any country subject to an embargo or other sanction by the United States, including, without limitation, Iran, Syria, Cuba, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, Sudan and North Korea, and you will not use any Offering for any purpose prohibited by the Export Laws.

D. **GovCloud Services.** If you access or use any Hosted Services in the specially isolated Amazon Web Services (&quot;**AWS**&quot;) GovCloud (US) region (including without limitation any Hosted Services that are provisioned in a FedRAMP authorized environment within the AWS GovCloud (US) region)), you hereby represent and warrant that: (i) you are a &quot;US Person&quot; as defined under ITAR (see 22 CFR part 120.62); (ii) you have and will maintain a valid Directorate of Defense Trade Controls registration, if required by ITAR; (iii) you and your end users are not subject to export control restrictions under US export control laws and regulations (i.e., users are not denied or debarred parties or otherwise subject to sanctions); (iv) you will maintain an effective compliance program to ensure compliance with applicable US export control laws and regulations, including ITAR, as applicable; and (v) you will maintain effective access controls as described in the Specific Offering Terms for the applicable Hosted Services. You are responsible for verifying that any user accessing Customer Content in the Hosted Services in the AWS GovCloud (US) region is eligible to access such Customer Content. The Hosted Services in the AWS GovCloud (US) region may not be used to process or store classified data. You will be responsible for all sanitization costs incurred by Splunk if users introduce classified data into the Hosted Services in the AWS GovCloud (US) region. You may be required to execute additional addendums to this agreement prior to provisioning of selected Hosted Services.

E. **Acceptable Use.** Without limiting any terms under these General Terms, you will also abide by our Hosted Services acceptable use policy: https://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAMB6.

#### **17. Confidentiality**

A. **Confidential Information.** Each party will protect the Confidential Information of the other.

#### **21. Term and Termination**

A. **Term and Renewal.** These General Terms will commence upon the Effective Date and will remain in effect until the expiration of all applicable Purchased Offerings, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Section. Termination of a specific Purchased Offering will not affect the Term of any other Purchased Offering. Termination of these General Terms will have the effect of terminating all Purchased Offerings. Grounds for terminating a Purchased Offering (e.g., for non-payment), that are specific to the Purchased Offering, will not be grounds to terminate Purchased Offerings where no breach exists. Unless indicated otherwise in an Order, the Term of a Purchased Offering (and these General Terms) will automatically renew for an additional period of time equal to the length of the preceding Term, unless one party notifies the other of its intent not to renew at least one (1) day in advance of the expiration of the Term or then-current renewal period.

B. **Termination.** Either party may terminate these General Terms, or any Purchased Offering, by written notice to the other party in the event of a material breach of these General Terms, or the specific terms associated with that Purchased Offering, that is not cured within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice.

Notwithstanding any early termination above, except for your termination for our uncured material breach, you will still be required to pay all Fees payable under an Order.

C. **Survival.** The termination or expiration of these General Terms will not affect any provisions herein which by their nature survive termination or expiration, including the provisions that deal with the following subject matters: definitions, ownership of intellectual property, confidentiality, payment obligations, effect of termination, limitation of liability, privacy, and the &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; section in these General Terms.

D. **Suspension of Service.** In the event of a material breach or threatened material breach of this Agreement, Splunk may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, suspend your use of the Hosted Service until such breach is cured or Splunk reasonably believes there is no longer a threat, provided that, we will give you at least five (5) days’ prior notice before suspension. Suspension of a Hosted Service will have no impact on the duration of the Term of the Purchased Offering, or the associated Fees owed.

#### **22. Limitation of Liability**

**In no event will the aggregate liability of either party, together with any of its Affiliates, arising out of or related to any Purchased Offering exceed the total amount paid by you for that Purchased Offering in the twelve (12) months preceding the first incident out of which the liability arose. However, the foregoing limitation will not limit your obligations under the &quot;Payment&quot; section above and will not be deemed to limit your rights to any service level credits under any applicable Service Level Schedule. Furthermore, the cap above will not be deemed to limit Splunk’s right to recover amounts for your use of an Offering in excess of the Capacity purchased or use outside of Internal Business Purposes.**

**In no event will either party or its Affiliates have any liability arising out of or related to these General Terms for any lost profits, revenues, goodwill, or indirect, special, incidental, consequential, cover, business interruption or punitive damages.**

**The foregoing limitations will apply whether the action is in contract or tort and regardless of the theory of liability, even if a party or its Affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages or if a party’s or its Affiliates’ remedy otherwise fails of its essential purpose.**

**The limitation of liability herein will not apply to a party’s infringement of the other party’s intellectual property rights, indemnification obligations, or the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of a party.**

**The foregoing disclaimers of damages will also not apply to the extent prohibited by law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. To the extent such a law applies to you, some or all of the exclusions or limitations set forth above may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights.**

#### **23. Indemnity**

A. **Our Indemnification to You.** Splunk will defend and indemnify you, and pay all damages (including attorneys’ fees and costs) awarded against you, or that are agreed to in a settlement, to the extent a claim, demand, suit or proceeding is made or brought against you or your Affiliates by a third party (including those brought by a government entity) alleging that a Purchased Offering infringes or misappropriates such third party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (a &quot;**Customer Claim**&quot;).

C. **Mutual Indemnity.** Each party will defend, indemnify and pay all damages (including attorneys’ fees and costs) awarded against the other party, or that are agreed to in a settlement to the extent that an action brought against the other party by a third party is based upon a claim for bodily injury (including death) to any person, or damage to tangible property resulting from the negligent acts or willful misconduct of the indemnifying party or its personnel hereunder, and will pay any reasonable, direct, out-of-pocket costs, damages and reasonable attorneys’ fees attributable to such claim that are awarded against the indemnified party (or are payable in settlement by the indemnified party).

D. **Process for Indemnification.** The indemnification obligations above are subject to the party seeking indemnification to: (i) provide the other party with prompt written notice of the specific claim; (ii) give the indemnifying party sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim (except that the indemnifying party may not settle any claim that requires any action or forbearance on the indemnified party’s part without their prior consent, which will not unreasonably withhold or delay); and (iii) gives the indemnifying party all reasonable assistance, at such party’s expense.

We agree to discuss in good faith any condition or requirement you may have for our Personnel that are different from standard policies, however any additional requirement may delay C&I Services and must be vetted and implemented by mutual agreement of the parties and expressly set forth in a Statement of Work. Splunk does not guarantee that it will be able to meet any additional requested requirements.

If we elect to consider a Change Order Request, then we will promptly notify you if we believe that the Change Order Request requires an adjustment to the fees or to the schedule for the performance of the C&I Services.

Splunk will comply with your (or your Third-Party Providers’) reasonable security procedures.

B. **Overages.** If a verification or usage report reveals that you have exceeded the purchased Capacity or usage rights for your Purchased Offering (e.g., used as a service bureau) during the period reviewed, then we will have the right to invoice you using the applicable Fees at list price then in effect, which will be payable in accordance with these General Terms. Without limiting Splunk’s foregoing rights, with respect to Hosted Services, Splunk may work with you to reduce usage so that it conforms to the applicable usage limit, and we will in good faith discuss options to right size your subscription as appropriate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Splunk will have the right to directly invoice you for overages, regardless of whether you purchased the Purchased Offering from an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace. See the Specific Offering Terms for any additional information related to overages for a Hosted Service.

#### **13. Our Use of Open Source**

Certain Offerings may contain Open Source Software. Splunk makes available in the applicable Documentation a list of Open Source Software incorporated in our On-Premises Products as required by the respective Open Source Software licenses. Any Open Source Software that is delivered as part of your Offering and which may not be removed or used separately from the Offering is covered by the warranty, support and indemnification provisions applicable to the Offering. Some of the Open Source Software may have additional terms that apply to the use of the Offering (e.g., the obligation for us to provide attribution of the specific licensor), and those terms will be included in the Documentation; however, these terms will not (a) impose any additional restrictions on your use of the Offering, or (b) negate or amend any of our responsibilities with respect to the Offering.

#### **14. Splunk Developer Tools and Customer Extensions**

Splunk makes Splunk Developer Tools available to you so you can develop Extensions for use with your Purchased Offerings (Extensions that you develop, &quot;**Customer Extensions**&quot;).

You have a nonexclusive, worldwide, nontransferable, nonsublicensable right, subject to the terms of these General Terms, to use Splunk Developer Tools to develop your Customer Extensions, including to support interoperability between the Offering and your system or environment. Splunk proprietary legends or notices contained in the Splunk Developer Tools may not be removed or altered when used in or with your Customer Extension.

A. **Third-Party Extensions on Splunkbase.** Splunk makes Extensions developed and/or made available by a third-party on Splunkbase (&quot;**Third-Party Extension**&quot;) available for download or access as a convenience to its customers. Splunk makes no promises or guarantees related to any Third-Party Extension, including the accuracy, integrity, quality, or security of the Third-Party Extension. Nothing in these General Terms or on Splunkbase will be deemed to be a representation or warranty by Splunk with respect to any Third-Party Extension, even if a particular Third-Party Extension is identified as &quot;certified&quot; or &quot;validated&quot; for use with an Offering. We may, in our reasonable discretion, block or disable access to any Third-Party Extension at any time. Your use of a Third-Party Extension is at your own risk and may be subject to any additional terms, conditions, and policies applicable to that Third-Party Extension (such as license terms, terms of service, or privacy policies of the providers of such Third-Party Extension). Third-Party Extensions may be installed on Hosted Services pursuant to our instructions.

B. **Third Party Content.** Hosted Services may contain features or functions that enable interoperation with Third-Party Content that you, in your sole discretion, choose to add to a Hosted Service. You may be required to obtain access separately to such Third-Party Content from the respective providers, and you may be required to grant Splunk access to your accounts with such providers to the extent necessary for Splunk to allow the interoperation with the Hosted Service. By requesting or allowing Splunk to enable access to such Third-Party Content in connection with the Hosted Services, you certify that you are authorized under the provider’s terms to allow such access. If you install or enable (or direct or otherwise authorize Splunk to install or enable) Third-Party Content for use with a Hosted Service where the interoperation includes access by the third-party provider to your Customer Content, you hereby authorize Splunk to allow the provider of such Third-Party Content to access Customer Content as necessary for the interoperation. You agree that Splunk is not responsible or liable for disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Content resulting from access to Customer Content by such Third-Party Content, nor is Splunk liable for any damages or downtime that you may incur or any impact on your experience of the Hosted Service, directly or indirectly, as a result of your use of and/or reliance upon, any Third-Party Content, sites or resources.

C. **Splunk As a Reseller.** When you purchase third party products (&quot;**Third Party Products**&quot;) from Splunk as specified in an Order (which products shall include third party software, but not any support which Splunk itself has contracted to provide), the following provision applies. Splunk acts solely as a reseller of Third Party Products, which are fulfilled by the relevant third party vendor (&quot;**Third Party Vendor**&quot;), and the purchase and use of Third Party Products is subject solely to the terms, conditions and policies made available by such Third Party Vendor. Consequently, Splunk makes no representation or warranty of any kind regarding the Third Party Products, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, and specifically disclaims all implied terms, conditions and warranties (including as to quality, performance, availability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. You will bring any claim in relation to Third Party Products against the applicable Third Party Vendor directly. In no event will Splunk be liable to you for any claim, loss or damage arising out of the use, operation or availability of Third Party Product (whether such liability arises in contract, negligence, tort, or otherwise).

D. **Unsupported Splunk Extensions.** The Service Level Schedule commitments for any applicable Hosted Services will not apply to Splunk Extensions labeled on Splunkbase as &quot;**Not Supported.**&quot; You agree that Splunk is not responsible for any impact on your experience of a Hosted Service, as a result of your installation and/or use of any &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extensions, and that your sole remedy will be to remove the &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extension from the applicable Hosted Service. Further, some Splunk Extensions may not be compatible or certified for use with that Hosted Service (e.g., only specific Splunk Extensions are validated for our FedRAMP authorized environment for Splunk Cloud Platform). Please refer to the applicable Documentation for more information related to the Splunk Extensions compatible with your specific Purchased Offering.

B. **Compelled Disclosure of Confidential Information.** Notwithstanding the foregoing terms, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is compelled by law enforcement agencies or regulators to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a Party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to such Confidential Information.

The payment terms below only apply when you purchase Offerings directly from Splunk. When you purchase from an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, the payment terms are between you and the authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace.

#### **21. Term and Termination**

A. **Term and Renewal.** These General Terms will commence upon the Effective Date and will remain in effect until the expiration of all applicable Purchased Offerings, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Section. Termination of a specific Purchased Offering will not affect the Term of any other Purchased Offering. Termination of these General Terms will have the effect of terminating all Purchased Offerings. Grounds for terminating a Purchased Offering (e.g., for non-payment), that are specific to the Purchased Offering, will not be grounds to terminate Purchased Offerings where no breach exists. Unless indicated otherwise in an Order, the Term of a Purchased Offering (and these General Terms) will automatically renew for an additional period of time equal to the length of the preceding Term, unless one party notifies the other of its intent not to renew at least one (1) day in advance of the expiration of the Term or then-current renewal period.

B. **Termination.** Either party may terminate these General Terms, or any Purchased Offering, by written notice to the other party in the event of a material breach of these General Terms, or the specific terms associated with that Purchased Offering, that is not cured within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice.

D. **Suspension of Service.** In the event of a material breach or threatened material breach of this Agreement, Splunk may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, suspend your use of the Hosted Service until such breach is cured or Splunk reasonably believes there is no longer a threat, provided that, we will give you at least five (5) days’ prior notice before suspension. Suspension of a Hosted Service will have no impact on the duration of the Term of the Purchased Offering, or the associated Fees owed.

#### **22. Limitation of Liability**

**In no event will the aggregate liability of either party, together with any of its Affiliates, arising out of or related to any Purchased Offering exceed the total amount paid by you for that Purchased Offering in the twelve (12) months preceding the first incident out of which the liability arose. However, the foregoing limitation will not limit your obligations under the &quot;Payment&quot; section above and will not be deemed to limit your rights to any service level credits under any applicable Service Level Schedule. Furthermore, the cap above will not be deemed to limit Splunk’s right to recover amounts for your use of an Offering in excess of the Capacity purchased or use outside of Internal Business Purposes.**

**In no event will either party or its Affiliates have any liability arising out of or related to these General Terms for any lost profits, revenues, goodwill, or indirect, special, incidental, consequential, cover, business interruption or punitive damages.**

**The foregoing limitations will apply whether the action is in contract or tort and regardless of the theory of liability, even if a party or its Affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages or if a party’s or its Affiliates’ remedy otherwise fails of its essential purpose.**

**The limitation of liability herein will not apply to a party’s infringement of the other party’s intellectual property rights, indemnification obligations, or the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of a party.**

**The foregoing disclaimers of damages will also not apply to the extent prohibited by law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. To the extent such a law applies to you, some or all of the exclusions or limitations set forth above may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights.**

#### **23. Indemnity**

A. **Our Indemnification to You.** Splunk will defend and indemnify you, and pay all damages (including attorneys’ fees and costs) awarded against you, or that are agreed to in a settlement, to the extent a claim, demand, suit or proceeding is made or brought against you or your Affiliates by a third party (including those brought by a government entity) alleging that a Purchased Offering infringes or misappropriates such third party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (a &quot;**Customer Claim**&quot;).

C. **Mutual Indemnity.** Each party will defend, indemnify and pay all damages (including attorneys’ fees and costs) awarded against the other party, or that are agreed to in a settlement to the extent that an action brought against the other party by a third party is based upon a claim for bodily injury (including death) to any person, or damage to tangible property resulting from the negligent acts or willful misconduct of the indemnifying party or its personnel hereunder, and will pay any reasonable, direct, out-of-pocket costs, damages and reasonable attorneys’ fees attributable to such claim that are awarded against the indemnified party (or are payable in settlement by the indemnified party).

D. **Process for Indemnification.** The indemnification obligations above are subject to the party seeking indemnification to: (i) provide the other party with prompt written notice of the specific claim; (ii) give the indemnifying party sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim (except that the indemnifying party may not settle any claim that requires any action or forbearance on the indemnified party’s part without their prior consent, which will not unreasonably withhold or delay); and (iii) gives the indemnifying party all reasonable assistance, at such party’s expense.

4. **Case Priority**

    Each Support Program offers different support levels for your case priority levels. When submitting a case, you will select the priority for initial response by logging the case online, in accordance with the priority guidelines set forth under your Support Program.

When that happens, we will provide you with notice (electronic or otherwise) of such change.

3. **Our Background Checks, Security and Compliance Obligations**

    A. **Compliance with Your Security Program.** While on your premises, our Personnel will comply with your security practices and procedures generally prescribed by you for onsite visitors and service providers. However, any requirement that is in addition to the compliance requirements set forth in this Schedule (e.g., background checks that are different from the background checks described herein) must be expressly set forth in a Statement of Work. We agree to discuss in good faith any condition or requirement you may have for our Personnel that are different from standard policies, however any additional requirement may delay C&I Services and must be vetted and implemented by mutual agreement of the parties and expressly set forth in a Statement of Work. Splunk does not guarantee that it will be able to meet any additional requested requirements.

    B. **Our Security Practices.** We implement and follow an enterprise security program, with the policies, plans, and procedures set forth here [www.splunk.com/prof-serv-isa](www.splunk.com/prof-serv-isa).

If we elect to consider a Change Order Request, then we will promptly notify you if we believe that the Change Order Request requires an adjustment to the fees or to the schedule for the performance of the C&I Services. In such event, the parties will negotiate in good faith a reasonable and equitable adjustment to the fees and/or schedule, as applicable. We will continue to perform C&I Services pursuant to the existing Statement of Work and will have no obligation to perform any Change Order Request unless and until the parties have agreed in writing to such an equitable adjustment.

By clicking on the appropriate button, or by downloading, installing, accessing or using the Offerings, you agree to these General Terms. If you are entering into these General Terms on behalf of Customer, you represent that you have the authority to bind Customer. If you do not agree to these General Terms, or if you are not authorized to accept the General Terms on behalf of the Customer, do not download, install, access, or use any of the Offerings.

**See the General Terms Definitions Exhibit attached for definitions of capitalized terms not defined herein.**

C. **Splunk Extensions.** You may use Splunk Extensions solely in connection with the applicable Purchased Offering subject to the same terms and conditions for that Offering (including with respect to Term) and payment of any Fees associated with the Splunk Extensions. Some Splunk Extensions may be made available under license terms that provide broader rights than the license rights you have to the applicable underlying Offering (e.g., if the Extension is Open Source Software). These broader rights will apply to that Splunk Extension. Splunk Extensions may be installed on Hosted Services pursuant to our instructions.

D. **Trials, Evaluations, Beta and Free Licenses.**

<ol type="i">
  <li><b>Trials and Evaluations.</b> Offerings provided for trials and evaluations are provided at no charge, and their use will be for a limited duration.</li>
  <li><b>Beta Licenses.</b> Some Offerings and features may be available to you as a preview, or as an alpha, beta or other pre-release version (each, a "<b>Beta Offering</b>"). All rights for Beta Offerings are solely for internal testing and evaluation. Your use of a Beta Offering will be for the term specified by us, and if no term is specified, then for the earlier of one year from the start date of the Beta Offering or when that version of the Beta Offering becomes generally available. We may discontinue the Beta Offering at any time and may decide not to make any of the features and functionality generally available.</li>
  <li><b>Free Licenses.</b> From time to time, we may make certain Offerings available for full use (i.e., not subject to limited evaluation purposes) at no charge. These free Offerings may have limited features, functions, and other technical limitations.</li>
  <li><b>Donated Offerings.</b> Donated Offerings are free limited Offerings donated to qualifying Nonprofits under a Splunk donation program. By procuring and making use of a Donated Offering, you hereby represent and warrant that you are a lawfully organized Nonprofit, and you agree to provide verification of your nonprofit status to Splunk upon request. At Splunk’s request, you agree: (a) to publish a press release and case study on your use of the Donated Offering; and (b) to be interviewed for the production of a Splunk customer video that will accompany the press release and case study. Splunk will draft and edit all content in collaboration with you and will obtain your edits and written approval (email is sufficient) prior to publication, and such approval will not be unreasonably withheld. You will allow Splunk to reference your Nonprofit and leading spokespeople in press releases with your written approval (email is sufficient). Splunk may use your name and logo on sales presentations, websites, and other marketing collateral without your prior approval.</li>
 <li><b>Test and Development Licenses.</b> For Offerings identified as "<b>Test and Development</b>" Offerings on your Order, you only have the right to use those Offerings up to the applicable Capacity on a non-production system for non-production uses, including product migration testing or pre-production staging, or testing new data sources, types, or use cases. Test and Development Offerings may not be used for any revenue generation, commercial activity, or other productive business or purpose.</li>
<li><b>Limitations.</b> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these General Terms, we do not provide maintenance and support, warranties, service level commitments, or indemnification for Test and Development Offerings, trials, evaluations, or free or Beta Offerings.</li>
</ol>

You will have no direct Fee payment obligations to Splunk for those Offerings. However, in the event that you fail to pay the Digital Marketplace for your Purchased Offerings, Splunk retains the right to enforce your payment obligations and collect directly from you.

Any terms agreed to between you and the authorized reseller that are in addition to these General Terms are solely between you and the authorized reseller and Digital Marketplace, as applicable. No agreement between you and an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace is binding on Splunk or will have any force or effect with respect to the rights in, or the operation, use or provision of, the Offerings.

B. **Splunk Affiliate Distributors.** Splunk has appointed certain Splunk Affiliates as its non-exclusive distributors of the Offerings (each, a &quot;**Splunk Affiliate Distributor**&quot;). Each Splunk Affiliate Distributor is authorized by Splunk to negotiate and enter into Orders with Customers. Where a purchase from Splunk is offered by a Splunk Affiliate Distributor, Customer will issue Orders, and make payments, to the Splunk Affiliate Distributor which issued the quote for the Offering. Each Order will be deemed a separate contract between Customer and the relevant Splunk Affiliate Distributor and will be subject to these General Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer agrees that: (i) the total liability of Splunk under these General Terms as set forth in Section 22 (Limitation of Liability) states the overall combined liability of Splunk and Splunk Affiliate Distributors; (ii) the entering into Orders by a Splunk Affiliate Distributor will not be deemed to expand Splunk and its Affiliates’ overall responsibilities or liability under these General Terms; and (iii) Customer will have no right to recover more than once from the same event.

#### **3. Your Contractors and Third-Party Providers**

You may permit your authorized consultants, contractors, and agents (&quot;**Third-Party Providers**&quot;) to access and use your Purchased Offerings, but only on your behalf in connection with providing services to you, and subject to the terms and conditions of these General Terms. Any access or use by a Third-Party Provider will be subject to the same limitations and restrictions that apply to you under these General Terms, and you will be responsible for any Third-Party Provider’s actions relating to their use of the Offering. The aggregate use by you and all of your Third-Party Providers must not exceed the Capacity purchased, and nothing in this Section is intended to or will be deemed to increase such Capacity.

Splunk categorizes product vulnerabilities in accordance with the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (&quot;Medium,&quot; &quot;High,&quot; or &quot;Critical&quot;) and uses commercially reasonable efforts to remediate vulnerabilities depending on their severity level in accordance with industry standards.

#### **12. Capacity and Usage Verification**

A. **Certification and Verification.** At Splunk’s request, you will furnish Splunk a certification signed by your authorized representative verifying that your use of the Purchased Offering is in accordance with these General Terms and the applicable Order. For On-Premises Products, we may also ask you from time to time, but not more frequently than once per calendar period, to cooperate with us to verify usage and adherence to purchased Capacities. If Splunk requests a verification process, you agree to provide Splunk reasonable access to the On-Premises Product installed at your facility (or as hosted by your Third-Party Provider). If Splunk does any verification, it will be performed with as little interference as possible to your use of the On-Premises Product and your business operations. Splunk will comply with your (or your Third-Party Providers’) reasonable security procedures.

B. **Overages.** If a verification or usage report reveals that you have exceeded the purchased Capacity or usage rights for your Purchased Offering (e.g., used as a service bureau) during the period reviewed, then we will have the right to invoice you using the applicable Fees at list price then in effect, which will be payable in accordance with these General Terms. Without limiting Splunk’s foregoing rights, with respect to Hosted Services, Splunk may work with you to reduce usage so that it conforms to the applicable usage limit, and we will in good faith discuss options to right size your subscription as appropriate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Splunk will have the right to directly invoice you for overages, regardless of whether you purchased the Purchased Offering from an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace. See the Specific Offering Terms for any additional information related to overages for a Hosted Service.

#### **13. Our Use of Open Source**

Certain Offerings may contain Open Source Software. Splunk makes available in the applicable Documentation a list of Open Source Software incorporated in our On-Premises Products as required by the respective Open Source Software licenses. Any Open Source Software that is delivered as part of your Offering and which may not be removed or used separately from the Offering is covered by the warranty, support and indemnification provisions applicable to the Offering. Some of the Open Source Software may have additional terms that apply to the use of the Offering (e.g., the obligation for us to provide attribution of the specific licensor), and those terms will be included in the Documentation; however, these terms will not (a) impose any additional restrictions on your use of the Offering, or (b) negate or amend any of our responsibilities with respect to the Offering.

A. **Third-Party Extensions on Splunkbase.** Splunk makes Extensions developed and/or made available by a third-party on Splunkbase (&quot;**Third-Party Extension**&quot;) available for download or access as a convenience to its customers. Splunk makes no promises or guarantees related to any Third-Party Extension, including the accuracy, integrity, quality, or security of the Third-Party Extension. Nothing in these General Terms or on Splunkbase will be deemed to be a representation or warranty by Splunk with respect to any Third-Party Extension, even if a particular Third-Party Extension is identified as &quot;certified&quot; or &quot;validated&quot; for use with an Offering. We may, in our reasonable discretion, block or disable access to any Third-Party Extension at any time. Your use of a Third-Party Extension is at your own risk and may be subject to any additional terms, conditions, and policies applicable to that Third-Party Extension (such as license terms, terms of service, or privacy policies of the providers of such Third-Party Extension). Third-Party Extensions may be installed on Hosted Services pursuant to our instructions.

B. **Third Party Content.** Hosted Services may contain features or functions that enable interoperation with Third-Party Content that you, in your sole discretion, choose to add to a Hosted Service. You may be required to obtain access separately to such Third-Party Content from the respective providers, and you may be required to grant Splunk access to your accounts with such providers to the extent necessary for Splunk to allow the interoperation with the Hosted Service. By requesting or allowing Splunk to enable access to such Third-Party Content in connection with the Hosted Services, you certify that you are authorized under the provider’s terms to allow such access. If you install or enable (or direct or otherwise authorize Splunk to install or enable) Third-Party Content for use with a Hosted Service where the interoperation includes access by the third-party provider to your Customer Content, you hereby authorize Splunk to allow the provider of such Third-Party Content to access Customer Content as necessary for the interoperation. You agree that Splunk is not responsible or liable for disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Content resulting from access to Customer Content by such Third-Party Content, nor is Splunk liable for any damages or downtime that you may incur or any impact on your experience of the Hosted Service, directly or indirectly, as a result of your use of and/or reliance upon, any Third-Party Content, sites or resources.

C. **Splunk As a Reseller.** When you purchase third party products (&quot;**Third Party Products**&quot;) from Splunk as specified in an Order (which products shall include third party software, but not any support which Splunk itself has contracted to provide), the following provision applies. Splunk acts solely as a reseller of Third Party Products, which are fulfilled by the relevant third party vendor (&quot;**Third Party Vendor**&quot;), and the purchase and use of Third Party Products is subject solely to the terms, conditions and policies made available by such Third Party Vendor. Consequently, Splunk makes no representation or warranty of any kind regarding the Third Party Products, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, and specifically disclaims all implied terms, conditions and warranties (including as to quality, performance, availability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. You will bring any claim in relation to Third Party Products against the applicable Third Party Vendor directly. In no event will Splunk be liable to you for any claim, loss or damage arising out of the use, operation or availability of Third Party Product (whether such liability arises in contract, negligence, tort, or otherwise).

D. **Unsupported Splunk Extensions.** The Service Level Schedule commitments for any applicable Hosted Services will not apply to Splunk Extensions labeled on Splunkbase as &quot;**Not Supported.**&quot; You agree that Splunk is not responsible for any impact on your experience of a Hosted Service, as a result of your installation and/or use of any &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extensions, and that your sole remedy will be to remove the &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extension from the applicable Hosted Service. Further, some Splunk Extensions may not be compatible or certified for use with that Hosted Service (e.g., only specific Splunk Extensions are validated for our FedRAMP authorized environment for Splunk Cloud Platform). Please refer to the applicable Documentation for more information related to the Splunk Extensions compatible with your specific Purchased Offering.

The Hosted Services in the AWS GovCloud (US) region may not be used to process or store classified data. You will be responsible for all sanitization costs incurred by Splunk if users introduce classified data into the Hosted Services in the AWS GovCloud (US) region. You may be required to execute additional addendums to this agreement prior to provisioning of selected Hosted Services.

A. **Confidential Information.** Each party will protect the Confidential Information of the other.

B. **Compelled Disclosure of Confidential Information.** Notwithstanding the foregoing terms, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is compelled by law enforcement agencies or regulators to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a Party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to such Confidential Information.

#### **18. Payment**

The payment terms below only apply when you purchase Offerings directly from Splunk. When you purchase from an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, the payment terms are between you and the authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace. However, a breach of your payment obligations for an Offering with a Digital Marketplace will be deemed a breach of this Section 18.

A. **Fees.** You agree to pay all Fees specified in the Orders. Fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except as otherwise expressly set forth in these General Terms. Without limiting any of our other rights or remedies herein, overdue charges may accrue interest monthly at the rate of 1.5% of the then-outstanding unpaid balance, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower.

#### **19. Splunk’s Warranties**

#### **21. Term and Termination**

A. **Term and Renewal.** These General Terms will commence upon the Effective Date and will remain in effect until the expiration of all applicable Purchased Offerings, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Section. Termination of a specific Purchased Offering will not affect the Term of any other Purchased Offering. Termination of these General Terms will have the effect of terminating all Purchased Offerings. Grounds for terminating a Purchased Offering (e.g., for non-payment), that are specific to the Purchased Offering, will not be grounds to terminate Purchased Offerings where no breach exists. Unless indicated otherwise in an Order, the Term of a Purchased Offering (and these General Terms) will automatically renew for an additional period of time equal to the length of the preceding Term, unless one party notifies the other of its intent not to renew at least one (1) day in advance of the expiration of the Term or then-current renewal period.

B. **Termination.** Either party may terminate these General Terms, or any Purchased Offering, by written notice to the other party in the event of a material breach of these General Terms, or the specific terms associated with that Purchased Offering, that is not cured within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice. Upon any expiration or termination of a Purchased Offering, the rights and licenses granted to you for that Purchased Offering will automatically terminate, and you agree to immediately (i) cease using and accessing the Offering, (ii) return or destroy all copies of any On-Premises Products and other Splunk materials and Splunk Confidential Information in your possession or control, and (iii) upon our request, certify in writing the completion of such return or destruction. Upon termination of these General Terms or any Purchased Offering, Splunk will have no obligation to refund any Fees or other amounts received from you during the Term. Notwithstanding any early termination above, except for your termination for our uncured material breach, you will still be required to pay all Fees payable under an Order.

C. **Survival.** The termination or expiration of these General Terms will not affect any provisions herein which by their nature survive termination or expiration, including the provisions that deal with the following subject matters: definitions, ownership of intellectual property, confidentiality, payment obligations, effect of termination, limitation of liability, privacy, and the &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; section in these General Terms.

D. **Suspension of Service.** In the event of a material breach or threatened material breach of this Agreement, Splunk may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, suspend your use of the Hosted Service until such breach is cured or Splunk reasonably believes there is no longer a threat, provided that, we will give you at least five (5) days’ prior notice before suspension. Suspension of a Hosted Service will have no impact on the duration of the Term of the Purchased Offering, or the associated Fees owed.

#### **22. Limitation of Liability**

**In no event will the aggregate liability of either party, together with any of its Affiliates, arising out of or related to any Purchased Offering exceed the total amount paid by you for that Purchased Offering in the twelve (12) months preceding the first incident out of which the liability arose. However, the foregoing limitation will not limit your obligations under the &quot;Payment&quot; section above and will not be deemed to limit your rights to any service level credits under any applicable Service Level Schedule.

# **SPLUNK GENERAL TERMS**

These Splunk General Terms (&quot;General Terms&quot;) between Splunk Inc., a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business at 270 Brannan Street, San Francisco, California 94107, U.S.A (&quot;Splunk&quot; or &quot;we&quot; or &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) and you (&quot;Customer&quot; or &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) apply to the purchase of licenses and subscriptions for Splunk’s Offerings. By clicking on the appropriate button, or by downloading, installing, accessing or using the Offerings, you agree to these General Terms. If you are entering into these General Terms on behalf of Customer, you represent that you have the authority to bind Customer. If you do not agree to these General Terms, or if you are not authorized to accept the General Terms on behalf of the Customer, do not download, install, access, or use any of the Offerings.

**See the General Terms Definitions Exhibit attached for definitions of capitalized terms not defined herein.**

#### **1. License Rights**

A. **General Rights.** You have the nonexclusive, worldwide, nontransferable and nonsublicensable right, subject to payment of applicable Fees and compliance with the terms of these General Terms, to use your Purchased Offerings for your Internal Business Purposes during the Term and up to the Capacity purchased.

B. **Copies for On-Premise Products.** You have the right to make a reasonable number of copies of On-Premises Products for archival and back-up purposes.

C. **Splunk Extensions.** You may use Splunk Extensions solely in connection with the applicable Purchased Offering subject to the same terms and conditions for that Offering (including with respect to Term) and payment of any Fees associated with the Splunk Extensions. Some Splunk Extensions may be made available under license terms that provide broader rights than the license rights you have to the applicable underlying Offering (e.g., if the Extension is Open Source Software). These broader rights will apply to that Splunk Extension. Splunk Extensions may be installed on Hosted Services pursuant to our instructions.

D. **Trials, Evaluations, Beta and Free Licenses.**

<ol type="i">
  <li><b>Trials and Evaluations.</b> Offerings provided for trials and evaluations are provided at no charge, and their use will be for a limited duration.</li>
  <li><b>Beta Licenses.</b> Some Offerings and features may be available to you as a preview, or as an alpha, beta or other pre-release version (each, a "<b>Beta Offering</b>"). All rights for Beta Offerings are solely for internal testing and evaluation. Your use of a Beta Offering will be for the term specified by us, and if no term is specified, then for the earlier of one year from the start date of the Beta Offering or when that version of the Beta Offering becomes generally available. We may discontinue the Beta Offering at any time and may decide not to make any of the features and functionality generally available.</li>
  <li><b>Free Licenses.</b> From time to time, we may make certain Offerings available for full use (i.e., not subject to limited evaluation purposes) at no charge. These free Offerings may have limited features, functions, and other technical limitations.</li>
  <li><b>Donated Offerings.</b> Donated Offerings are free limited Offerings donated to qualifying Nonprofits under a Splunk donation program. By procuring and making use of a Donated Offering, you hereby represent and warrant that you are a lawfully organized Nonprofit, and you agree to provide verification of your nonprofit status to Splunk upon request. At Splunk’s request, you agree: (a) to publish a press release and case study on your use of the Donated Offering; and (b) to be interviewed for the production of a Splunk customer video that will accompany the press release and case study. Splunk will draft and edit all content in collaboration with you and will obtain your edits and written approval (email is sufficient) prior to publication, and such approval will not be unreasonably withheld. You will allow Splunk to reference your Nonprofit and leading spokespeople in press releases with your written approval (email is sufficient). Splunk may use your name and logo on sales presentations, websites, and other marketing collateral without your prior approval.</li>
 <li><b>Test and Development Licenses.</b> For Offerings identified as "<b>Test and Development</b>" Offerings on your Order, you only have the right to use those Offerings up to the applicable Capacity on a non-production system for non-production uses, including product migration testing or pre-production staging, or testing new data sources, types, or use cases. Test and Development Offerings may not be used for any revenue generation, commercial activity, or other productive business or purpose.</li>
<li><b>Limitations.</b> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these General Terms, we do not provide maintenance and support, warranties, service level commitments, or indemnification for Test and Development Offerings, trials, evaluations, or free or Beta Offerings.</li>
</ol>

#### **2. Purchasing Through Authorized Resellers, Digital Marketplaces, and Splunk Affiliates**

A. **Authorized Resellers and Digital Marketplaces.** If you purchase Offerings through a Splunk authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, these General Terms will govern those Offerings. Your payment obligations for the Purchased Offerings will be with the authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, as applicable, not Splunk. You will have no direct Fee payment obligations to Splunk for those Offerings. However, in the event that you fail to pay the Digital Marketplace for your Purchased Offerings, Splunk retains the right to enforce your payment obligations and collect directly from you.

Any terms agreed to between you and the authorized reseller that are in addition to these General Terms are solely between you and the authorized reseller and Digital Marketplace, as applicable. No agreement between you and an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace is binding on Splunk or will have any force or effect with respect to the rights in, or the operation, use or provision of, the Offerings.

B. **Splunk Affiliate Distributors.** Splunk has appointed certain Splunk Affiliates as its non-exclusive distributors of the Offerings (each, a &quot;**Splunk Affiliate Distributor**&quot;). Each Splunk Affiliate Distributor is authorized by Splunk to negotiate and enter into Orders with Customers. Where a purchase from Splunk is offered by a Splunk Affiliate Distributor, Customer will issue Orders, and make payments, to the Splunk Affiliate Distributor which issued the quote for the Offering. Each Order will be deemed a separate contract between Customer and the relevant Splunk Affiliate Distributor and will be subject to these General Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer agrees that: (i) the total liability of Splunk under these General Terms as set forth in Section 22 (Limitation of Liability) states the overall combined liability of Splunk and Splunk Affiliate Distributors; (ii) the entering into Orders by a Splunk Affiliate Distributor will not be deemed to expand Splunk and its Affiliates’ overall responsibilities or liability under these General Terms; and (iii) Customer will have no right to recover more than once from the same event.

#### **3. Your Contractors and Third-Party Providers**

You may permit your authorized consultants, contractors, and agents (&quot;**Third-Party Providers**&quot;) to access and use your Purchased Offerings, but only on your behalf in connection with providing services to you, and subject to the terms and conditions of these General Terms. Any access or use by a Third-Party Provider will be subject to the same limitations and restrictions that apply to you under these General Terms, and you will be responsible for any Third-Party Provider’s actions relating to their use of the Offering. The aggregate use by you and all of your Third-Party Providers must not exceed the Capacity purchased, and nothing in this Section is intended to or will be deemed to increase such Capacity.

#### **4. Hosted Services and Specific Offering Terms**

A. **Service Levels.** When you purchase Hosted Services as a Purchased Offering, we will make the applicable Hosted Services available to you during the Term in accordance with these General Terms. The Service Level Schedules (as identified in the Specific Offering Terms referenced in Section 4(F) below) and associated remedies will apply to the availability and uptime of the applicable Hosted Service. If applicable, service credits will be available for downtime in accordance with the Service Level Schedule.

B. **Connections.** You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all telecommunications, broadband and computer equipment and services needed to access and use Hosted Services, and for paying all associated charges.

C. **Your Responsibility for Data Protection.** You are responsible for: (i) selecting from the security configurations and security options made available by Splunk in connection with a Hosted Service; (ii) taking additional measures outside of the Hosted Service to the extent the Hosted Service Offering does not provide the controls that may be required or desired by you; and (iii) routine archiving and backing up of Customer Content. You agree to notify Splunk promptly if you believe that an unauthorized third party may be using your accounts or if your account information is lost or stolen.

D. **Refund Upon Termination for Splunk’s Breach.** If a Hosted Service is terminated by you for Splunk’s uncured material breach in accordance with these General Terms, Splunk will refund you any prepaid subscription fees covering the remainder of the Term after the effective date of termination.

E. **Return of Customer Content.** Customer Content may be retrieved by you and removed from the Hosted Services in accordance with the applicable Documentation. We will make the Customer Content available on the Hosted Services for thirty (30) days after termination of a subscription for your retrieval. After that thirty (30) day period, we will have no obligation to maintain the storage of your Customer Content, and you hereby authorize us thereafter to, and we will, unless legally prohibited, delete all remaining Customer Content. If you require assistance in connection with migration of your Customer Content, depending on the nature of the request, we may require a mutually agreed upon fee for assistance.

F. **Specific Offering Terms.** Specific security controls and certifications, data policies, service descriptions, Service Level Schedules and other terms specific to a Hosted Service and other Offerings (&quot;**Specific Offering Terms**&quot;) are set forth here: [www.splunk.com/SpecificTerms](www.splunk.com/SpecificTerms), and will apply, and be deemed incorporated herein by reference.

#### **5. Support and Maintenance**

The specific Support Program included with a Purchased Offering will be identified in the applicable Order. Splunk will provide the purchased level of support and maintenance services in accordance with the terms of the Support Exhibit attached to these General Terms.

#### **6. Configuration and Implementation Services**

Splunk offers standard services to implement and configure your Purchased Offerings. These services are purchased under an Order and are subject to the payment of the Fees therein and the terms of the Configuration and Implementation Services Exhibit attached to these General Terms.

#### **7. Data Protection for Personal Data**

Splunk will follow globally recognized data protection principles and industry-leading standards for the security of personal data. Splunk will comply with the requirements and obligations set forth in Splunk’s Data Processing Addendum (&quot;**DPA**&quot;), located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-dpa.html, which includes standard terms for the processing of personal data (including, as applicable, personal data in a Hosted Service).

#### **8. Security**

A. **Security for Hosted Services: Standard Environment.** Splunk will implement industry leading security safeguards for the protection of Customer Confidential Information, including Customer Content transferred to and stored within the Hosted Services. These safeguards include commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect Customer Content against destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or unauthorized access, including such things as information security policies and procedures, security awareness training, threat and vulnerability management, incident response and breach notification, and vendor risk management. Splunk’s technical safeguards are further described in the Splunk Cloud Platform Security Addendum (&quot;**SC-SA**&quot;), located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-cloud-security-addendum.html, and the Observability Suite Security Addendum (&quot;**OS-SA**&quot;), located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-observability-security-addendum.html, as applicable, and are incorporated herein by reference. Splunk may update the SC-SA and OS-SA from time to time provided, that updates will be subject to Section 24 below.

B. **Security for Hosted Services: Premium HIPAA Environment.** For Hosted Services Offerings provisioned in Splunk Cloud Platform’s Premium HIPAA environment (as specified in an Order), in addition to the protections under the SC-SA and these General Terms, Splunk will comply with the requirements and obligations set forth in Splunk Business Associate Agreement found here: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-baa.html.

C. **Additional Security for Other Hosted Services.** From time to time, Splunk may offer custom security safeguards for unique Hosted Services offerings. Any such security safeguards will be as set forth in the applicable Documentation and Specific Offering Terms.

Splunk’s Corporate Security Controls include such things as information security policies and procedures, security awareness training, physical and environmental access controls, threat and vulnerability management, incident response and breach notification, and vendor risk management. Splunk’s Corporate Security Controls are further described in Splunk’s Information Security Addendum (&quot;**ISA**&quot;), located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/information-security-addendum.html and are incorporated herein by reference.

E. **Product Development Security.** Splunk will follow secure software development practices and applies an industry standard, risk-based approach to its software development lifecycle (&quot;**SDLC**&quot;), which includes, as applicable, such things as performing security architecture reviews, open source security scans, virus detection, dynamic application security testing, network vulnerability scans and external penetration testing in the development environment. Product-specific information about the SDLC in our Offerings is detailed more fully in the ISA. Splunk’s Product Security Portal, located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/product-security.html, contains detailed information about Splunk’s program for managing and communicating product vulnerabilities. Splunk categorizes product vulnerabilities in accordance with the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (&quot;Medium,&quot; &quot;High,&quot; or &quot;Critical&quot;) and uses commercially reasonable efforts to remediate vulnerabilities depending on their severity level in accordance with industry standards.

F. **Maintaining Protections.** Notwithstanding anything to contrary in these General Terms, or any policy or terms referenced herein via hyperlink (or any update thereto), Splunk may not, during a Term materially diminish the security protections set forth in these General Terms, any Specific Offering Terms, or the applicable security addendum.

#### **9. Use Restrictions**

Except as expressly permitted in an Order, these General Terms or our Documentation, you agree not to (nor allow any user or Third Party Provider to): (a) reverse engineer (except to the extent specifically permitted by statutory law), decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover source code or underlying structures, ideas or algorithms of any Offering; (b) modify, translate or create derivative works based on the Offerings; (c) use an Offering to ingest, monitor or analyze the machine, IT system or application data of any third party; (d) resell, transfer or distribute any Offering; (e) access or use any Offering in order to monitor its availability, performance, or functionality for competitive purposes; (f) attempt to disable or circumvent any license key or other technological mechanisms or measures intended to prevent, limit or control use or copying of, or access to, Offerings; (g) separately use any of the applicable features and functionalities of the Offerings with external applications or code not furnished by Splunk or any data not processed by the Offering; (h) exceed the Capacity purchased or (i) use any Offering in violation of all applicable laws and regulations (including but not limited to any applicable privacy and intellectual property laws).

#### **10. Our Ethics, Compliance and Corporate Responsibility**

A. **Ethics and Corporate Responsibility.** Splunk is committed to acting ethically and in compliance with applicable law, and we have policies and guidelines in place to provide awareness of, and compliance with, the laws and regulations that apply to our business globally. We are committed to ethical business conduct, and we use diligent efforts to perform in accordance with the highest global ethical principles, as described in the Splunk Code of Conduct and Ethics found [here](https://investors.splunk.com/static-files/3c2a9a40-7f6e-4795-9358-b5565826b13d?_ga=2.27382325.82146825.1675981089-269939538.1673288458&_gac=1.127441023.1674005341.Cj0KCQiAq5meBhCyARIsAJrtdr75-RptXmmxNnKzoOJ_p26uX0MwT-GzxcrmWSotrQqWFlaOLtYVyhgaAuriEALw_wcB&_gl=1*1xgvjcs*_ga*MjY5OTM5NTM4LjE2NzMyODg0NTg.*_ga_5EPM2P39FV*MTY3NjA1MTkwNi40OC4xLjE2NzYwNjAxMzMuMzYuMC4w).

B. **Anti-Corruption.** We implement and maintain programs for compliance with applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. Splunk policy prohibits the offering or soliciting of any illegal or improper bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value to or from any of your employees or agents in connection with these General Terms. If we learn of any violation of the above, we will use reasonable efforts to promptly notify you at the main contact address provided by you to Splunk.

C. **Export.** We certify that Splunk is not on any of the relevant U.S. or EU government lists of prohibited persons, including the Treasury Department’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and the Commerce Department’s List of Denied Persons or Entity List. Export information regarding our Offerings, including our export control classifications for our Offerings, is found here: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/export-controls.html.

#### **11. Usage Data**

From time to time, Splunk may collect Usage Data generated as a by-product of your use of Offerings. Usage Data does not include Customer Content. We collect Usage Data for a variety of reasons, such as to identify, understand, and anticipate performance issues and the factors that affect them, to provide updates and personalized experiences to customers, and to improve the Splunk Offerings. Details on Splunk’s Usage Data collection practices are set forth in Splunk's Privacy Policy found here: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/privacy/privacy-policy.html.

#### **12. Capacity and Usage Verification**

A. **Certification and Verification.** At Splunk’s request, you will furnish Splunk a certification signed by your authorized representative verifying that your use of the Purchased Offering is in accordance with these General Terms and the applicable Order. For On-Premises Products, we may also ask you from time to time, but not more frequently than once per calendar period, to cooperate with us to verify usage and adherence to purchased Capacities. If Splunk requests a verification process, you agree to provide Splunk reasonable access to the On-Premises Product installed at your facility (or as hosted by your Third-Party Provider). If Splunk does any verification, it will be performed with as little interference as possible to your use of the On-Premises Product and your business operations. Splunk will comply with your (or your Third-Party Providers’) reasonable security procedures.

B. **Overages.** If a verification or usage report reveals that you have exceeded the purchased Capacity or usage rights for your Purchased Offering (e.g., used as a service bureau) during the period reviewed, then we will have the right to invoice you using the applicable Fees at list price then in effect, which will be payable in accordance with these General Terms. Without limiting Splunk’s foregoing rights, with respect to Hosted Services, Splunk may work with you to reduce usage so that it conforms to the applicable usage limit, and we will in good faith discuss options to right size your subscription as appropriate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Splunk will have the right to directly invoice you for overages, regardless of whether you purchased the Purchased Offering from an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace. See the Specific Offering Terms for any additional information related to overages for a Hosted Service.

#### **13. Our Use of Open Source**

Certain Offerings may contain Open Source Software. Splunk makes available in the applicable Documentation a list of Open Source Software incorporated in our On-Premises Products as required by the respective Open Source Software licenses. Any Open Source Software that is delivered as part of your Offering and which may not be removed or used separately from the Offering is covered by the warranty, support and indemnification provisions applicable to the Offering. Some of the Open Source Software may have additional terms that apply to the use of the Offering (e.g., the obligation for us to provide attribution of the specific licensor), and those terms will be included in the Documentation; however, these terms will not (a) impose any additional restrictions on your use of the Offering, or (b) negate or amend any of our responsibilities with respect to the Offering.

#### **14. Splunk Developer Tools and Customer Extensions**

Splunk makes Splunk Developer Tools available to you so you can develop Extensions for use with your Purchased Offerings (Extensions that you develop, &quot;**Customer Extensions**&quot;).

You have a nonexclusive, worldwide, nontransferable, nonsublicensable right, subject to the terms of these General Terms, to use Splunk Developer Tools to develop your Customer Extensions, including to support interoperability between the Offering and your system or environment. Splunk proprietary legends or notices contained in the Splunk Developer Tools may not be removed or altered when used in or with your Customer Extension. You retain title to your Customer Extensions, subject to Splunk’s ownership in our Offerings and any materials and technology provided by Splunk in connection with the Splunk Developer Tools. You agree to assume full responsibility for the performance and distribution of Customer Extensions.

#### **15. Third Party Products, Third-Party Extensions, Third-Party Content and Unsupported Splunk Extensions**

A. **Third-Party Extensions on Splunkbase.** Splunk makes Extensions developed and/or made available by a third-party on Splunkbase (&quot;**Third-Party Extension**&quot;) available for download or access as a convenience to its customers. Splunk makes no promises or guarantees related to any Third-Party Extension, including the accuracy, integrity, quality, or security of the Third-Party Extension. Nothing in these General Terms or on Splunkbase will be deemed to be a representation or warranty by Splunk with respect to any Third-Party Extension, even if a particular Third-Party Extension is identified as &quot;certified&quot; or &quot;validated&quot; for use with an Offering. We may, in our reasonable discretion, block or disable access to any Third-Party Extension at any time. Your use of a Third-Party Extension is at your own risk and may be subject to any additional terms, conditions, and policies applicable to that Third-Party Extension (such as license terms, terms of service, or privacy policies of the providers of such Third-Party Extension). Third-Party Extensions may be installed on Hosted Services pursuant to our instructions.

B. **Third Party Content.** Hosted Services may contain features or functions that enable interoperation with Third-Party Content that you, in your sole discretion, choose to add to a Hosted Service. You may be required to obtain access separately to such Third-Party Content from the respective providers, and you may be required to grant Splunk access to your accounts with such providers to the extent necessary for Splunk to allow the interoperation with the Hosted Service. By requesting or allowing Splunk to enable access to such Third-Party Content in connection with the Hosted Services, you certify that you are authorized under the provider’s terms to allow such access. If you install or enable (or direct or otherwise authorize Splunk to install or enable) Third-Party Content for use with a Hosted Service where the interoperation includes access by the third-party provider to your Customer Content, you hereby authorize Splunk to allow the provider of such Third-Party Content to access Customer Content as necessary for the interoperation. You agree that Splunk is not responsible or liable for disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Content resulting from access to Customer Content by such Third-Party Content, nor is Splunk liable for any damages or downtime that you may incur or any impact on your experience of the Hosted Service, directly or indirectly, as a result of your use of and/or reliance upon, any Third-Party Content, sites or resources.

C. **Splunk As a Reseller.** When you purchase third party products (&quot;**Third Party Products**&quot;) from Splunk as specified in an Order (which products shall include third party software, but not any support which Splunk itself has contracted to provide), the following provision applies. Splunk acts solely as a reseller of Third Party Products, which are fulfilled by the relevant third party vendor (&quot;**Third Party Vendor**&quot;), and the purchase and use of Third Party Products is subject solely to the terms, conditions and policies made available by such Third Party Vendor.

#### **21. Term and Termination**

A. **Term and Renewal.** These General Terms will commence upon the Effective Date and will remain in effect until the expiration of all applicable Purchased Offerings, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Section. Termination of a specific Purchased Offering will not affect the Term of any other Purchased Offering. Termination of these General Terms will have the effect of terminating all Purchased Offerings. Grounds for terminating a Purchased Offering (e.g., for non-payment), that are specific to the Purchased Offering, will not be grounds to terminate Purchased Offerings where no breach exists. Unless indicated otherwise in an Order, the Term of a Purchased Offering (and these General Terms) will automatically renew for an additional period of time equal to the length of the preceding Term, unless one party notifies the other of its intent not to renew at least one (1) day in advance of the expiration of the Term or then-current renewal period.

B. **Termination.** Either party may terminate these General Terms, or any Purchased Offering, by written notice to the other party in the event of a material breach of these General Terms, or the specific terms associated with that Purchased Offering, that is not cured within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice.

D. **Suspension of Service.** In the event of a material breach or threatened material breach of this Agreement, Splunk may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, suspend your use of the Hosted Service until such breach is cured or Splunk reasonably believes there is no longer a threat, provided that, we will give you at least five (5) days’ prior notice before suspension.

However, the foregoing limitation will not limit your obligations under the &quot;Payment&quot; section above and will not be deemed to limit your rights to any service level credits under any applicable Service Level Schedule. Furthermore, the cap above will not be deemed to limit Splunk’s right to recover amounts for your use of an Offering in excess of the Capacity purchased or use outside of Internal Business Purposes.**

**In no event will either party or its Affiliates have any liability arising out of or related to these General Terms for any lost profits, revenues, goodwill, or indirect, special, incidental, consequential, cover, business interruption or punitive damages.**

**The limitation of liability herein will not apply to a party’s infringement of the other party’s intellectual property rights, indemnification obligations, or the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of a party.**

**The foregoing disclaimers of damages will also not apply to the extent prohibited by law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. To the extent such a law applies to you, some or all of the exclusions or limitations set forth above may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights.**

#### **23. Indemnity**

A. **Our Indemnification to You.** Splunk will defend and indemnify you, and pay all damages (including attorneys’ fees and costs) awarded against you, or that are agreed to in a settlement, to the extent a claim, demand, suit or proceeding is made or brought against you or your Affiliates by a third party (including those brought by a government entity) alleging that a Purchased Offering infringes or misappropriates such third party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (a &quot;**Customer Claim**&quot;).

3. **Support Policy**

    Our Support Policy, provided here: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-software-support-policy.html (&quot;**Support Policy**&quot;) describes the duration of our Support Services for certain Splunk On-Premises Products and other policies associated with our Support Services.

    As we release new versions for our Offerings, we discontinue Support Services for certain older versions. Our Support Policy sets forth the schedule for the duration of support, and end of support, for Offering versions. The current versions of our Offerings that are supported under our Support Policy and will be our &quot;Supported Versions&quot; herein. The Support Policy may not apply to Hosted Services, and the product and services version we make available as our Hosted Services will be deemed Supported Versions herein.

4. **Case Priority**

    Each Support Program offers different support levels for your case priority levels. When submitting a case, you will select the priority for initial response by logging the case online, in accordance with the priority guidelines set forth under your Support Program. When the case is received, we may in good faith change the priority if the issue does not conform to the criteria for the selected priority. When that happens, we will provide you with notice (electronic or otherwise) of such change.

5. **Exclusions**

    We will have no obligation to provide support for issues caused by any of the following (each, a &quot;**Customer Generated Error**&quot;): (i) modifications to an Offering not made by Splunk; (ii) use of an Offering other than as authorized in the General Terms or as provided in the applicable Documentation; (iii) damage to the machine on which an On-Premises Product is installed; (iv) use of a version of an Offering other than the Supported Version; (v) third-party products that are not expressly noted in the Documentation as supported by Splunk; or (vi) conflicts related to replacing or installing hardware, drivers, and software that are not expressly supported by Splunk and described in the applicable Documentation. If we determine that support requested by you is for an issue caused by a Customer Generated Error, we will notify you of that fact as soon as reasonably possible under the circumstances. If you agree that we should provide support for the Customer Generated Error via a confirming email, then we will have the right to invoice you at our then-current time and materials rates for any such support provided by us.

6. **Support for Splunk Extensions**

    Only Splunk Extensions that are labeled as &quot;**Splunk Supported**&quot; on Splunkbase, or other Splunk-branded marketplace, are eligible for support, and this support is limited. For those labeled Splunk Supported, we will provide an initial response and acknowledgement in accordance with the P3 terms that are applicable in the applicable Support Program, and Enhancements may be made available. No other terms of a Support Program will apply to a Splunk Application. For those labeled as &quot;**Not Supported**,&quot; Splunk will have no support obligations.

7. **Authorized Support Contacts**

    You are entitled to have a certain number of Support Contacts under each Support Program. &quot;**Support Contacts**&quot; means the individual(s) specified by you that are authorized to submit support cases.

    The number of Support Contacts will be based on the Capacity of the Offering purchased, and the applicable Support Program. The number of Support Contacts will be set forth in customer’s entitlement information on the Splunk support portal.

    We only take support requests from, and communicate with, your Support Contacts in connection with support cases. We strongly recommend that your Support Contact(s) are trained on the applicable Offering. In order to designate Support Contacts, you must provide the individual’s primary email address and Splunk.com login ID.

8. **Defect Resolution**

    Should we determine that an Offering has a defect, we will, at our sole option, repair the defect in the version of the Offering that you are then currently using or instruct you to install a newer version of the Offering with that defect repaired. We reserve the right to provide you with a workaround in lieu of fixing a defect should we in our sole judgment determine that it is more effective to do so.

9. **Your Assistance**

    Should you report a purported defect or error in an Offering, we may require you to provide us with the following information: (a) a general description of your operating environment; (b) a list of all hardware components, operating systems and networks; (c) a reproducible test case; and (d) any log files, trace and systems files. Your failure to provide this information may prevent us from identifying and fixing that purported defect.

10. **Changes to Support Programs**

    You acknowledge that, subject to the Support Policy, and subject to any commitment we have during the Term, we have the right to discontinue the manufacture, development, sale or support of any Offering, at any time, in our sole discretion. We further reserve the right to alter Support Programs from time to time, using reasonable discretion, but in no event will such alterations, during the Term of any Order, result in diminished Support Services from the level of your applicable purchased Support Program.

3. **Our Background Checks, Security and Compliance Obligations**

    A. **Compliance with Your Security Program.** While on your premises, our Personnel will comply with your security practices and procedures generally prescribed by you for onsite visitors and service providers. However, any requirement that is in addition to the compliance requirements set forth in this Schedule (e.g., background checks that are different from the background checks described herein) must be expressly set forth in a Statement of Work. We agree to discuss in good faith any condition or requirement you may have for our Personnel that are different from standard policies, however any additional requirement may delay C&I Services and must be vetted and implemented by mutual agreement of the parties and expressly set forth in a Statement of Work. Splunk does not guarantee that it will be able to meet any additional requested requirements.

    B. **Our Security Practices.** We implement and follow an enterprise security program, with the policies, plans, and procedures set forth here [www.splunk.com/prof-serv-isa](www.splunk.com/prof-serv-isa).

    A. **C&I Services Materials.** The C&I Services we perform (e.g., configuration of our Offerings), and the C&I Services Materials we offer, create, and deliver to you in connection with the C&I Services, are generally applicable to our business, and therefore we require the right to be able to re-use the C&I Services Materials we create for one customer in connection with all of our customers. For the avoidance of doubt, our use of the C&I Services Materials created for you in connection with C&I Services will comply with our ongoing obligations and restrictions with respect to your Customer Materials and your Confidential Information, and we will not identify you in any way in connection with our further use of such C&I Services Materials.

    B. **Customer Owned Work Product.** However, in the unlikely event that the parties agree that C&I Services Materials for a project are custom work product unique to your business, and not applicable to other customers generally, we will transfer ownership to those agreed C&I Services Materials to you under the applicable Statement of Work. C&I Services Materials must be expressly identified as &quot;**Customer Owned Work Product**&quot; under a Statement of Work for ownership to pass to you. Subject to payment of applicable Fees under the Statement of Work, we hereby assign to you all rights, title and interest (including all Intellectual Property Rights therein) in and to all C&I Services Materials identified as Customer Owned Work Product (but excluding all Splunk Preexisting IP incorporated into the Customer Owned Work Product). At your request and expense, we will assist and cooperate with you in all reasonable respects and will execute documents and take such further acts reasonably requested by you to enable you to acquire, transfer, maintain, perfect, and enforce your ownership rights in such Customer Owned Work Product.

    C. **Our Ownership.** Subject to your ownership rights in Customer Owned Work Product and Customer Materials, we will own all rights in and to all C&I Services Materials.

As part of the Cooperation, you will (1) designate a project manager or technical lead to liaise with us while we perform the C&I Services; (2) allocate and engage additional resources as may be required to assist us in performing the C&I Services; and (3) making available to us any data, information and any other materials reasonably required by us to perform the C&I Services, including any data, information or materials specifically identified in the Statement of Work.

    You may submit written requests to us to change the scope of C&I Services described in a Statement of Work (each such request, a &quot;**Change Order Request**&quot;). If we elect to consider a Change Order Request, then we will promptly notify you if we believe that the Change Order Request requires an adjustment to the fees or to the schedule for the performance of the C&I Services. In such event, the parties will negotiate in good faith a reasonable and equitable adjustment to the fees and/or schedule, as applicable. We will continue to perform C&I Services pursuant to the existing Statement of Work and will have no obligation to perform any Change Order Request unless and until the parties have agreed in writing to such an equitable adjustment.

10. **Expenses**

    Unless otherwise specified in the Statement of Work, we will not charge you for our expenses we incur in connection with a Statement of Work.

By clicking on the appropriate button, or by downloading, installing, accessing or using the Offerings, you agree to these General Terms. If you are entering into these General Terms on behalf of Customer, you represent that you have the authority to bind Customer. If you do not agree to these General Terms, or if you are not authorized to accept the General Terms on behalf of the Customer, do not download, install, access, or use any of the Offerings.

**See the General Terms Definitions Exhibit attached for definitions of capitalized terms not defined herein.**

#### **1. License Rights**

C. **Splunk Extensions.** You may use Splunk Extensions solely in connection with the applicable Purchased Offering subject to the same terms and conditions for that Offering (including with respect to Term) and payment of any Fees associated with the Splunk Extensions. Some Splunk Extensions may be made available under license terms that provide broader rights than the license rights you have to the applicable underlying Offering (e.g., if the Extension is Open Source Software). These broader rights will apply to that Splunk Extension. Splunk Extensions may be installed on Hosted Services pursuant to our instructions.

D. **Trials, Evaluations, Beta and Free Licenses.**

<ol type="i">
  <li><b>Trials and Evaluations.</b> Offerings provided for trials and evaluations are provided at no charge, and their use will be for a limited duration.</li>
  <li><b>Beta Licenses.</b> Some Offerings and features may be available to you as a preview, or as an alpha, beta or other pre-release version (each, a "<b>Beta Offering</b>"). All rights for Beta Offerings are solely for internal testing and evaluation. Your use of a Beta Offering will be for the term specified by us, and if no term is specified, then for the earlier of one year from the start date of the Beta Offering or when that version of the Beta Offering becomes generally available. We may discontinue the Beta Offering at any time and may decide not to make any of the features and functionality generally available.</li>
  <li><b>Free Licenses.</b> From time to time, we may make certain Offerings available for full use (i.e., not subject to limited evaluation purposes) at no charge. These free Offerings may have limited features, functions, and other technical limitations.</li>
  <li><b>Donated Offerings.</b> Donated Offerings are free limited Offerings donated to qualifying Nonprofits under a Splunk donation program. By procuring and making use of a Donated Offering, you hereby represent and warrant that you are a lawfully organized Nonprofit, and you agree to provide verification of your nonprofit status to Splunk upon request. At Splunk’s request, you agree: (a) to publish a press release and case study on your use of the Donated Offering; and (b) to be interviewed for the production of a Splunk customer video that will accompany the press release and case study. Splunk will draft and edit all content in collaboration with you and will obtain your edits and written approval (email is sufficient) prior to publication, and such approval will not be unreasonably withheld. You will allow Splunk to reference your Nonprofit and leading spokespeople in press releases with your written approval (email is sufficient). Splunk may use your name and logo on sales presentations, websites, and other marketing collateral without your prior approval.</li>
 <li><b>Test and Development Licenses.</b> For Offerings identified as "<b>Test and Development</b>" Offerings on your Order, you only have the right to use those Offerings up to the applicable Capacity on a non-production system for non-production uses, including product migration testing or pre-production staging, or testing new data sources, types, or use cases. Test and Development Offerings may not be used for any revenue generation, commercial activity, or other productive business or purpose.</li>
<li><b>Limitations.</b> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these General Terms, we do not provide maintenance and support, warranties, service level commitments, or indemnification for Test and Development Offerings, trials, evaluations, or free or Beta Offerings.</li>
</ol>

#### **2. Purchasing Through Authorized Resellers, Digital Marketplaces, and Splunk Affiliates**

A. **Authorized Resellers and Digital Marketplaces.** If you purchase Offerings through a Splunk authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, these General Terms will govern those Offerings. Your payment obligations for the Purchased Offerings will be with the authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, as applicable, not Splunk. You will have no direct Fee payment obligations to Splunk for those Offerings. However, in the event that you fail to pay the Digital Marketplace for your Purchased Offerings, Splunk retains the right to enforce your payment obligations and collect directly from you.

Any terms agreed to between you and the authorized reseller that are in addition to these General Terms are solely between you and the authorized reseller and Digital Marketplace, as applicable. No agreement between you and an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace is binding on Splunk or will have any force or effect with respect to the rights in, or the operation, use or provision of, the Offerings.

B. **Splunk Affiliate Distributors.** Splunk has appointed certain Splunk Affiliates as its non-exclusive distributors of the Offerings (each, a &quot;**Splunk Affiliate Distributor**&quot;). Each Splunk Affiliate Distributor is authorized by Splunk to negotiate and enter into Orders with Customers. Where a purchase from Splunk is offered by a Splunk Affiliate Distributor, Customer will issue Orders, and make payments, to the Splunk Affiliate Distributor which issued the quote for the Offering. Each Order will be deemed a separate contract between Customer and the relevant Splunk Affiliate Distributor and will be subject to these General Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer agrees that: (i) the total liability of Splunk under these General Terms as set forth in Section 22 (Limitation of Liability) states the overall combined liability of Splunk and Splunk Affiliate Distributors; (ii) the entering into Orders by a Splunk Affiliate Distributor will not be deemed to expand Splunk and its Affiliates’ overall responsibilities or liability under these General Terms; and (iii) Customer will have no right to recover more than once from the same event.

#### **3. Your Contractors and Third-Party Providers**

You may permit your authorized consultants, contractors, and agents (&quot;**Third-Party Providers**&quot;) to access and use your Purchased Offerings, but only on your behalf in connection with providing services to you, and subject to the terms and conditions of these General Terms. Any access or use by a Third-Party Provider will be subject to the same limitations and restrictions that apply to you under these General Terms, and you will be responsible for any Third-Party Provider’s actions relating to their use of the Offering. The aggregate use by you and all of your Third-Party Providers must not exceed the Capacity purchased, and nothing in this Section is intended to or will be deemed to increase such Capacity.

#### **4. Hosted Services and Specific Offering Terms**

A. **Service Levels.** When you purchase Hosted Services as a Purchased Offering, we will make the applicable Hosted Services available to you during the Term in accordance with these General Terms. The Service Level Schedules (as identified in the Specific Offering Terms referenced in Section 4(F) below) and associated remedies will apply to the availability and uptime of the applicable Hosted Service. If applicable, service credits will be available for downtime in accordance with the Service Level Schedule.

B. **Connections.** You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all telecommunications, broadband and computer equipment and services needed to access and use Hosted Services, and for paying all associated charges.

C. **Your Responsibility for Data Protection.** You are responsible for: (i) selecting from the security configurations and security options made available by Splunk in connection with a Hosted Service; (ii) taking additional measures outside of the Hosted Service to the extent the Hosted Service Offering does not provide the controls that may be required or desired by you; and (iii) routine archiving and backing up of Customer Content. You agree to notify Splunk promptly if you believe that an unauthorized third party may be using your accounts or if your account information is lost or stolen.

D. **Refund Upon Termination for Splunk’s Breach.** If a Hosted Service is terminated by you for Splunk’s uncured material breach in accordance with these General Terms, Splunk will refund you any prepaid subscription fees covering the remainder of the Term after the effective date of termination.

#### **12. Capacity and Usage Verification**

A. **Certification and Verification.** At Splunk’s request, you will furnish Splunk a certification signed by your authorized representative verifying that your use of the Purchased Offering is in accordance with these General Terms and the applicable Order. For On-Premises Products, we may also ask you from time to time, but not more frequently than once per calendar period, to cooperate with us to verify usage and adherence to purchased Capacities. If Splunk requests a verification process, you agree to provide Splunk reasonable access to the On-Premises Product installed at your facility (or as hosted by your Third-Party Provider). If Splunk does any verification, it will be performed with as little interference as possible to your use of the On-Premises Product and your business operations. Splunk will comply with your (or your Third-Party Providers’) reasonable security procedures.

B. **Overages.** If a verification or usage report reveals that you have exceeded the purchased Capacity or usage rights for your Purchased Offering (e.g., used as a service bureau) during the period reviewed, then we will have the right to invoice you using the applicable Fees at list price then in effect, which will be payable in accordance with these General Terms. Without limiting Splunk’s foregoing rights, with respect to Hosted Services, Splunk may work with you to reduce usage so that it conforms to the applicable usage limit, and we will in good faith discuss options to right size your subscription as appropriate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Splunk will have the right to directly invoice you for overages, regardless of whether you purchased the Purchased Offering from an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace. See the Specific Offering Terms for any additional information related to overages for a Hosted Service.

#### **13. Our Use of Open Source**

Certain Offerings may contain Open Source Software. Splunk makes available in the applicable Documentation a list of Open Source Software incorporated in our On-Premises Products as required by the respective Open Source Software licenses. Any Open Source Software that is delivered as part of your Offering and which may not be removed or used separately from the Offering is covered by the warranty, support and indemnification provisions applicable to the Offering. Some of the Open Source Software may have additional terms that apply to the use of the Offering (e.g., the obligation for us to provide attribution of the specific licensor), and those terms will be included in the Documentation; however, these terms will not (a) impose any additional restrictions on your use of the Offering, or (b) negate or amend any of our responsibilities with respect to the Offering.

A. **Third-Party Extensions on Splunkbase.** Splunk makes Extensions developed and/or made available by a third-party on Splunkbase (&quot;**Third-Party Extension**&quot;) available for download or access as a convenience to its customers. Splunk makes no promises or guarantees related to any Third-Party Extension, including the accuracy, integrity, quality, or security of the Third-Party Extension. Nothing in these General Terms or on Splunkbase will be deemed to be a representation or warranty by Splunk with respect to any Third-Party Extension, even if a particular Third-Party Extension is identified as &quot;certified&quot; or &quot;validated&quot; for use with an Offering. We may, in our reasonable discretion, block or disable access to any Third-Party Extension at any time. Your use of a Third-Party Extension is at your own risk and may be subject to any additional terms, conditions, and policies applicable to that Third-Party Extension (such as license terms, terms of service, or privacy policies of the providers of such Third-Party Extension). Third-Party Extensions may be installed on Hosted Services pursuant to our instructions.

B. **Third Party Content.** Hosted Services may contain features or functions that enable interoperation with Third-Party Content that you, in your sole discretion, choose to add to a Hosted Service. You may be required to obtain access separately to such Third-Party Content from the respective providers, and you may be required to grant Splunk access to your accounts with such providers to the extent necessary for Splunk to allow the interoperation with the Hosted Service. By requesting or allowing Splunk to enable access to such Third-Party Content in connection with the Hosted Services, you certify that you are authorized under the provider’s terms to allow such access. If you install or enable (or direct or otherwise authorize Splunk to install or enable) Third-Party Content for use with a Hosted Service where the interoperation includes access by the third-party provider to your Customer Content, you hereby authorize Splunk to allow the provider of such Third-Party Content to access Customer Content as necessary for the interoperation. You agree that Splunk is not responsible or liable for disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Content resulting from access to Customer Content by such Third-Party Content, nor is Splunk liable for any damages or downtime that you may incur or any impact on your experience of the Hosted Service, directly or indirectly, as a result of your use of and/or reliance upon, any Third-Party Content, sites or resources.

C. **Splunk As a Reseller.** When you purchase third party products (&quot;**Third Party Products**&quot;) from Splunk as specified in an Order (which products shall include third party software, but not any support which Splunk itself has contracted to provide), the following provision applies. Splunk acts solely as a reseller of Third Party Products, which are fulfilled by the relevant third party vendor (&quot;**Third Party Vendor**&quot;), and the purchase and use of Third Party Products is subject solely to the terms, conditions and policies made available by such Third Party Vendor. Consequently, Splunk makes no representation or warranty of any kind regarding the Third Party Products, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, and specifically disclaims all implied terms, conditions and warranties (including as to quality, performance, availability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. You will bring any claim in relation to Third Party Products against the applicable Third Party Vendor directly. In no event will Splunk be liable to you for any claim, loss or damage arising out of the use, operation or availability of Third Party Product (whether such liability arises in contract, negligence, tort, or otherwise).

D. **Unsupported Splunk Extensions.** The Service Level Schedule commitments for any applicable Hosted Services will not apply to Splunk Extensions labeled on Splunkbase as &quot;**Not Supported.**&quot; You agree that Splunk is not responsible for any impact on your experience of a Hosted Service, as a result of your installation and/or use of any &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extensions, and that your sole remedy will be to remove the &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extension from the applicable Hosted Service. Further, some Splunk Extensions may not be compatible or certified for use with that Hosted Service (e.g., only specific Splunk Extensions are validated for our FedRAMP authorized environment for Splunk Cloud Platform). Please refer to the applicable Documentation for more information related to the Splunk Extensions compatible with your specific Purchased Offering.

B. **Compelled Disclosure of Confidential Information.** Notwithstanding the foregoing terms, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is compelled by law enforcement agencies or regulators to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a Party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to such Confidential Information.

#### **18. Payment**

The payment terms below only apply when you purchase Offerings directly from Splunk. When you purchase from an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, the payment terms are between you and the authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace. However, a breach of your payment obligations for an Offering with a Digital Marketplace will be deemed a breach of this Section 18.

A. **Fees.** You agree to pay all Fees specified in the Orders. Fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except as otherwise expressly set forth in these General Terms.

#### **21. Term and Termination**

A. **Term and Renewal.** These General Terms will commence upon the Effective Date and will remain in effect until the expiration of all applicable Purchased Offerings, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Section. Termination of a specific Purchased Offering will not affect the Term of any other Purchased Offering. Termination of these General Terms will have the effect of terminating all Purchased Offerings. Grounds for terminating a Purchased Offering (e.g., for non-payment), that are specific to the Purchased Offering, will not be grounds to terminate Purchased Offerings where no breach exists. Unless indicated otherwise in an Order, the Term of a Purchased Offering (and these General Terms) will automatically renew for an additional period of time equal to the length of the preceding Term, unless one party notifies the other of its intent not to renew at least one (1) day in advance of the expiration of the Term or then-current renewal period.

B. **Termination.** Either party may terminate these General Terms, or any Purchased Offering, by written notice to the other party in the event of a material breach of these General Terms, or the specific terms associated with that Purchased Offering, that is not cured within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice. Upon any expiration or termination of a Purchased Offering, the rights and licenses granted to you for that Purchased Offering will automatically terminate, and you agree to immediately (i) cease using and accessing the Offering, (ii) return or destroy all copies of any On-Premises Products and other Splunk materials and Splunk Confidential Information in your possession or control, and (iii) upon our request, certify in writing the completion of such return or destruction. Upon termination of these General Terms or any Purchased Offering, Splunk will have no obligation to refund any Fees or other amounts received from you during the Term. Notwithstanding any early termination above, except for your termination for our uncured material breach, you will still be required to pay all Fees payable under an Order.

C. **Survival.** The termination or expiration of these General Terms will not affect any provisions herein which by their nature survive termination or expiration, including the provisions that deal with the following subject matters: definitions, ownership of intellectual property, confidentiality, payment obligations, effect of termination, limitation of liability, privacy, and the &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; section in these General Terms.

D. **Suspension of Service.** In the event of a material breach or threatened material breach of this Agreement, Splunk may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, suspend your use of the Hosted Service until such breach is cured or Splunk reasonably believes there is no longer a threat, provided that, we will give you at least five (5) days’ prior notice before suspension. Suspension of a Hosted Service will have no impact on the duration of the Term of the Purchased Offering, or the associated Fees owed.

#### **22. Limitation of Liability**

**In no event will the aggregate liability of either party, together with any of its Affiliates, arising out of or related to any Purchased Offering exceed the total amount paid by you for that Purchased Offering in the twelve (12) months preceding the first incident out of which the liability arose. However, the foregoing limitation will not limit your obligations under the &quot;Payment&quot; section above and will not be deemed to limit your rights to any service level credits under any applicable Service Level Schedule. Furthermore, the cap above will not be deemed to limit Splunk’s right to recover amounts for your use of an Offering in excess of the Capacity purchased or use outside of Internal Business Purposes.**

**In no event will either party or its Affiliates have any liability arising out of or related to these General Terms for any lost profits, revenues, goodwill, or indirect, special, incidental, consequential, cover, business interruption or punitive damages.**

**The foregoing limitations will apply whether the action is in contract or tort and regardless of the theory of liability, even if a party or its Affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages or if a party’s or its Affiliates’ remedy otherwise fails of its essential purpose.**

**The limitation of liability herein will not apply to a party’s infringement of the other party’s intellectual property rights, indemnification obligations, or the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of a party.**

**The foregoing disclaimers of damages will also not apply to the extent prohibited by law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. To the extent such a law applies to you, some or all of the exclusions or limitations set forth above may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights.**

#### **23. Indemnity**

A. **Our Indemnification to You.** Splunk will defend and indemnify you, and pay all damages (including attorneys’ fees and costs) awarded against you, or that are agreed to in a settlement, to the extent a claim, demand, suit or proceeding is made or brought against you or your Affiliates by a third party (including those brought by a government entity) alleging that a Purchased Offering infringes or misappropriates such third party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (a &quot;**Customer Claim**&quot;). Splunk will have no obligation under the foregoing provision to the extent a Customer Claim arises from your breach of these General Terms, your Customer Content, Third-Party Extension, or the combination of the Offering with: (i) Customer Content; (ii) Third-Party Extensions; (iii) any software other than software provided by Splunk; or (iv) any hardware or equipment. However, Splunk will indemnify against combination claims to the extent (y) the combined software is necessary for the normal operation of the Purchased Offering (e.g., an operating system), or (z) the Purchased Offering provides substantially all the essential elements of the asserted infringement or misappropriation claim. Splunk may in its sole discretion and at no cost to you: (1) modify any Purchased Offering so that it no longer infringes or misappropriates a third party right, (2) obtain a license for your continued use of the Purchased Offering, in accordance with these General Terms, or (3) terminate the Purchased Offering and refund to you any prepaid fees covering the unexpired Term.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
    as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

# **SPLUNK GENERAL TERMS**

Last Updated: February 10, 2023

These Splunk General Terms (&quot;General Terms&quot;) between Splunk Inc., a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business at 270 Brannan Street, San Francisco, California 94107, U.S.A (&quot;Splunk&quot; or &quot;we&quot; or &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) and you (&quot;Customer&quot; or &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) apply to the purchase of licenses and subscriptions for Splunk’s Offerings. By clicking on the appropriate button, or by downloading, installing, accessing or using the Offerings, you agree to these General Terms. If you are entering into these General Terms on behalf of Customer, you represent that you have the authority to bind Customer. If you do not agree to these General Terms, or if you are not authorized to accept the General Terms on behalf of the Customer, do not download, install, access, or use any of the Offerings.

**See the General Terms Definitions Exhibit attached for definitions of capitalized terms not defined herein.**

#### **1. License Rights**

A. **General Rights.** You have the nonexclusive, worldwide, nontransferable and nonsublicensable right, subject to payment of applicable Fees and compliance with the terms of these General Terms, to use your Purchased Offerings for your Internal Business Purposes during the Term and up to the Capacity purchased.

B. **Copies for On-Premise Products.** You have the right to make a reasonable number of copies of On-Premises Products for archival and back-up purposes.

C. **Splunk Extensions.** You may use Splunk Extensions solely in connection with the applicable Purchased Offering subject to the same terms and conditions for that Offering (including with respect to Term) and payment of any Fees associated with the Splunk Extensions. Some Splunk Extensions may be made available under license terms that provide broader rights than the license rights you have to the applicable underlying Offering (e.g., if the Extension is Open Source Software). These broader rights will apply to that Splunk Extension. Splunk Extensions may be installed on Hosted Services pursuant to our instructions.

D. **Trials, Evaluations, Beta and Free Licenses.**

<ol type="i">
  <li><b>Trials and Evaluations.</b> Offerings provided for trials and evaluations are provided at no charge, and their use will be for a limited duration.</li>
  <li><b>Beta Licenses.</b> Some Offerings and features may be available to you as a preview, or as an alpha, beta or other pre-release version (each, a "<b>Beta Offering</b>"). All rights for Beta Offerings are solely for internal testing and evaluation. Your use of a Beta Offering will be for the term specified by us, and if no term is specified, then for the earlier of one year from the start date of the Beta Offering or when that version of the Beta Offering becomes generally available. We may discontinue the Beta Offering at any time and may decide not to make any of the features and functionality generally available.</li>
  <li><b>Free Licenses.</b> From time to time, we may make certain Offerings available for full use (i.e., not subject to limited evaluation purposes) at no charge. These free Offerings may have limited features, functions, and other technical limitations.</li>
  <li><b>Donated Offerings.</b> Donated Offerings are free limited Offerings donated to qualifying Nonprofits under a Splunk donation program. By procuring and making use of a Donated Offering, you hereby represent and warrant that you are a lawfully organized Nonprofit, and you agree to provide verification of your nonprofit status to Splunk upon request. At Splunk’s request, you agree: (a) to publish a press release and case study on your use of the Donated Offering; and (b) to be interviewed for the production of a Splunk customer video that will accompany the press release and case study. Splunk will draft and edit all content in collaboration with you and will obtain your edits and written approval (email is sufficient) prior to publication, and such approval will not be unreasonably withheld. You will allow Splunk to reference your Nonprofit and leading spokespeople in press releases with your written approval (email is sufficient). Splunk may use your name and logo on sales presentations, websites, and other marketing collateral without your prior approval.</li>
 <li><b>Test and Development Licenses.</b> For Offerings identified as "<b>Test and Development</b>" Offerings on your Order, you only have the right to use those Offerings up to the applicable Capacity on a non-production system for non-production uses, including product migration testing or pre-production staging, or testing new data sources, types, or use cases. Test and Development Offerings may not be used for any revenue generation, commercial activity, or other productive business or purpose.</li>
<li><b>Limitations.</b> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these General Terms, we do not provide maintenance and support, warranties, service level commitments, or indemnification for Test and Development Offerings, trials, evaluations, or free or Beta Offerings.</li>
</ol>

#### **2. Purchasing Through Authorized Resellers, Digital Marketplaces, and Splunk Affiliates**

A. **Authorized Resellers and Digital Marketplaces.** If you purchase Offerings through a Splunk authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, these General Terms will govern those Offerings. Your payment obligations for the Purchased Offerings will be with the authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, as applicable, not Splunk. You will have no direct Fee payment obligations to Splunk for those Offerings. However, in the event that you fail to pay the Digital Marketplace for your Purchased Offerings, Splunk retains the right to enforce your payment obligations and collect directly from you.

Any terms agreed to between you and the authorized reseller that are in addition to these General Terms are solely between you and the authorized reseller and Digital Marketplace, as applicable. No agreement between you and an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace is binding on Splunk or will have any force or effect with respect to the rights in, or the operation, use or provision of, the Offerings.

B. **Splunk Affiliate Distributors.** Splunk has appointed certain Splunk Affiliates as its non-exclusive distributors of the Offerings (each, a &quot;**Splunk Affiliate Distributor**&quot;). Each Splunk Affiliate Distributor is authorized by Splunk to negotiate and enter into Orders with Customers. Where a purchase from Splunk is offered by a Splunk Affiliate Distributor, Customer will issue Orders, and make payments, to the Splunk Affiliate Distributor which issued the quote for the Offering. Each Order will be deemed a separate contract between Customer and the relevant Splunk Affiliate Distributor and will be subject to these General Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer agrees that: (i) the total liability of Splunk under these General Terms as set forth in Section 22 (Limitation of Liability) states the overall combined liability of Splunk and Splunk Affiliate Distributors; (ii) the entering into Orders by a Splunk Affiliate Distributor will not be deemed to expand Splunk and its Affiliates’ overall responsibilities or liability under these General Terms; and (iii) Customer will have no right to recover more than once from the same event.

#### **3. Your Contractors and Third-Party Providers**

You may permit your authorized consultants, contractors, and agents (&quot;**Third-Party Providers**&quot;) to access and use your Purchased Offerings, but only on your behalf in connection with providing services to you, and subject to the terms and conditions of these General Terms. Any access or use by a Third-Party Provider will be subject to the same limitations and restrictions that apply to you under these General Terms, and you will be responsible for any Third-Party Provider’s actions relating to their use of the Offering. The aggregate use by you and all of your Third-Party Providers must not exceed the Capacity purchased, and nothing in this Section is intended to or will be deemed to increase such Capacity.

#### **4. Hosted Services and Specific Offering Terms**

A. **Service Levels.** When you purchase Hosted Services as a Purchased Offering, we will make the applicable Hosted Services available to you during the Term in accordance with these General Terms. The Service Level Schedules (as identified in the Specific Offering Terms referenced in Section 4(F) below) and associated remedies will apply to the availability and uptime of the applicable Hosted Service. If applicable, service credits will be available for downtime in accordance with the Service Level Schedule.

B. **Connections.** You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all telecommunications, broadband and computer equipment and services needed to access and use Hosted Services, and for paying all associated charges.

C. **Your Responsibility for Data Protection.** You are responsible for: (i) selecting from the security configurations and security options made available by Splunk in connection with a Hosted Service; (ii) taking additional measures outside of the Hosted Service to the extent the Hosted Service Offering does not provide the controls that may be required or desired by you; and (iii) routine archiving and backing up of Customer Content. You agree to notify Splunk promptly if you believe that an unauthorized third party may be using your accounts or if your account information is lost or stolen.

D. **Refund Upon Termination for Splunk’s Breach.** If a Hosted Service is terminated by you for Splunk’s uncured material breach in accordance with these General Terms, Splunk will refund you any prepaid subscription fees covering the remainder of the Term after the effective date of termination.

E. **Return of Customer Content.** Customer Content may be retrieved by you and removed from the Hosted Services in accordance with the applicable Documentation. We will make the Customer Content available on the Hosted Services for thirty (30) days after termination of a subscription for your retrieval. After that thirty (30) day period, we will have no obligation to maintain the storage of your Customer Content, and you hereby authorize us thereafter to, and we will, unless legally prohibited, delete all remaining Customer Content. If you require assistance in connection with migration of your Customer Content, depending on the nature of the request, we may require a mutually agreed upon fee for assistance.

F. **Specific Offering Terms.** Specific security controls and certifications, data policies, service descriptions, Service Level Schedules and other terms specific to a Hosted Service and other Offerings (&quot;**Specific Offering Terms**&quot;) are set forth here: [www.splunk.com/SpecificTerms](www.splunk.com/SpecificTerms), and will apply, and be deemed incorporated herein by reference.

#### **5. Support and Maintenance**

The specific Support Program included with a Purchased Offering will be identified in the applicable Order. Splunk will provide the purchased level of support and maintenance services in accordance with the terms of the Support Exhibit attached to these General Terms.

#### **6. Configuration and Implementation Services**

Splunk offers standard services to implement and configure your Purchased Offerings. These services are purchased under an Order and are subject to the payment of the Fees therein and the terms of the Configuration and Implementation Services Exhibit attached to these General Terms.

#### **7. Data Protection for Personal Data**

Splunk will follow globally recognized data protection principles and industry-leading standards for the security of personal data. Splunk will comply with the requirements and obligations set forth in Splunk’s Data Processing Addendum (&quot;**DPA**&quot;), located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-dpa.html, which includes standard terms for the processing of personal data (including, as applicable, personal data in a Hosted Service).

#### **8. Security**

A. **Security for Hosted Services: Standard Environment.** Splunk will implement industry leading security safeguards for the protection of Customer Confidential Information, including Customer Content transferred to and stored within the Hosted Services. These safeguards include commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect Customer Content against destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or unauthorized access, including such things as information security policies and procedures, security awareness training, threat and vulnerability management, incident response and breach notification, and vendor risk management. Splunk’s technical safeguards are further described in the Splunk Cloud Platform Security Addendum (&quot;**SC-SA**&quot;), located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-cloud-security-addendum.html, and the Observability Suite Security Addendum (&quot;**OS-SA**&quot;), located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-observability-security-addendum.html, as applicable, and are incorporated herein by reference. Splunk may update the SC-SA and OS-SA from time to time provided, that updates will be subject to Section 24 below.

B. **Security for Hosted Services: Premium HIPAA Environment.** For Hosted Services Offerings provisioned in Splunk Cloud Platform’s Premium HIPAA environment (as specified in an Order), in addition to the protections under the SC-SA and these General Terms, Splunk will comply with the requirements and obligations set forth in Splunk Business Associate Agreement found here: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-baa.html.

C. **Additional Security for Other Hosted Services.** From time to time, Splunk may offer custom security safeguards for unique Hosted Services offerings. Any such security safeguards will be as set forth in the applicable Documentation and Specific Offering Terms.

D. **Security for On Premises Offerings.** Splunk will implement industry leading security safeguards for the protection of Splunk’s IT systems, products, facilities and assets, and any Customer Confidential Information accessed or processed therein, e.g., customer account information, support tickets (&quot;**Corporate Security Controls**&quot;). Splunk’s Corporate Security Controls include such things as information security policies and procedures, security awareness training, physical and environmental access controls, threat and vulnerability management, incident response and breach notification, and vendor risk management. Splunk’s Corporate Security Controls are further described in Splunk’s Information Security Addendum (&quot;**ISA**&quot;), located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/information-security-addendum.html and are incorporated herein by reference.

E. **Product Development Security.** Splunk will follow secure software development practices and applies an industry standard, risk-based approach to its software development lifecycle (&quot;**SDLC**&quot;), which includes, as applicable, such things as performing security architecture reviews, open source security scans, virus detection, dynamic application security testing, network vulnerability scans and external penetration testing in the development environment. Product-specific information about the SDLC in our Offerings is detailed more fully in the ISA. Splunk’s Product Security Portal, located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/product-security.html, contains detailed information about Splunk’s program for managing and communicating product vulnerabilities. Splunk categorizes product vulnerabilities in accordance with the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (&quot;Medium,&quot; &quot;High,&quot; or &quot;Critical&quot;) and uses commercially reasonable efforts to remediate vulnerabilities depending on their severity level in accordance with industry standards.

F. **Maintaining Protections.** Notwithstanding anything to contrary in these General Terms, or any policy or terms referenced herein via hyperlink (or any update thereto), Splunk may not, during a Term materially diminish the security protections set forth in these General Terms, any Specific Offering Terms, or the applicable security addendum.

#### **9. Use Restrictions**

Except as expressly permitted in an Order, these General Terms or our Documentation, you agree not to (nor allow any user or Third Party Provider to): (a) reverse engineer (except to the extent specifically permitted by statutory law), decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover source code or underlying structures, ideas or algorithms of any Offering; (b) modify, translate or create derivative works based on the Offerings; (c) use an Offering to ingest, monitor or analyze the machine, IT system or application data of any third party; (d) resell, transfer or distribute any Offering; (e) access or use any Offering in order to monitor its availability, performance, or functionality for competitive purposes; (f) attempt to disable or circumvent any license key or other technological mechanisms or measures intended to prevent, limit or control use or copying of, or access to, Offerings; (g) separately use any of the applicable features and functionalities of the Offerings with external applications or code not furnished by Splunk or any data not processed by the Offering; (h) exceed the Capacity purchased or (i) use any Offering in violation of all applicable laws and regulations (including but not limited to any applicable privacy and intellectual property laws).

#### **10. Our Ethics, Compliance and Corporate Responsibility**

A. **Ethics and Corporate Responsibility.** Splunk is committed to acting ethically and in compliance with applicable law, and we have policies and guidelines in place to provide awareness of, and compliance with, the laws and regulations that apply to our business globally. We are committed to ethical business conduct, and we use diligent efforts to perform in accordance with the highest global ethical principles, as described in the Splunk Code of Conduct and Ethics found [here](https://investors.splunk.com/static-files/3c2a9a40-7f6e-4795-9358-b5565826b13d?_ga=2.27382325.82146825.1675981089-269939538.1673288458&_gac=1.127441023.1674005341.Cj0KCQiAq5meBhCyARIsAJrtdr75-RptXmmxNnKzoOJ_p26uX0MwT-GzxcrmWSotrQqWFlaOLtYVyhgaAuriEALw_wcB&_gl=1*1xgvjcs*_ga*MjY5OTM5NTM4LjE2NzMyODg0NTg.*_ga_5EPM2P39FV*MTY3NjA1MTkwNi40OC4xLjE2NzYwNjAxMzMuMzYuMC4w).

B. **Anti-Corruption.** We implement and maintain programs for compliance with applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. Splunk policy prohibits the offering or soliciting of any illegal or improper bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value to or from any of your employees or agents in connection with these General Terms. If we learn of any violation of the above, we will use reasonable efforts to promptly notify you at the main contact address provided by you to Splunk.

C. **Export.** We certify that Splunk is not on any of the relevant U.S. or EU government lists of prohibited persons, including the Treasury Department’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and the Commerce Department’s List of Denied Persons or Entity List. Export information regarding our Offerings, including our export control classifications for our Offerings, is found here: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/export-controls.html.

#### **11. Usage Data**

From time to time, Splunk may collect Usage Data generated as a by-product of your use of Offerings. Usage Data does not include Customer Content. We collect Usage Data for a variety of reasons, such as to identify, understand, and anticipate performance issues and the factors that affect them, to provide updates and personalized experiences to customers, and to improve the Splunk Offerings. Details on Splunk’s Usage Data collection practices are set forth in Splunk's Privacy Policy found here: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/privacy/privacy-policy.html.

#### **12. Capacity and Usage Verification**

A. **Certification and Verification.** At Splunk’s request, you will furnish Splunk a certification signed by your authorized representative verifying that your use of the Purchased Offering is in accordance with these General Terms and the applicable Order. For On-Premises Products, we may also ask you from time to time, but not more frequently than once per calendar period, to cooperate with us to verify usage and adherence to purchased Capacities. If Splunk requests a verification process, you agree to provide Splunk reasonable access to the On-Premises Product installed at your facility (or as hosted by your Third-Party Provider). If Splunk does any verification, it will be performed with as little interference as possible to your use of the On-Premises Product and your business operations. Splunk will comply with your (or your Third-Party Providers’) reasonable security procedures.

B. **Overages.** If a verification or usage report reveals that you have exceeded the purchased Capacity or usage rights for your Purchased Offering (e.g., used as a service bureau) during the period reviewed, then we will have the right to invoice you using the applicable Fees at list price then in effect, which will be payable in accordance with these General Terms. Without limiting Splunk’s foregoing rights, with respect to Hosted Services, Splunk may work with you to reduce usage so that it conforms to the applicable usage limit, and we will in good faith discuss options to right size your subscription as appropriate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Splunk will have the right to directly invoice you for overages, regardless of whether you purchased the Purchased Offering from an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace. See the Specific Offering Terms for any additional information related to overages for a Hosted Service.

#### **13. Our Use of Open Source**

Certain Offerings may contain Open Source Software. Splunk makes available in the applicable Documentation a list of Open Source Software incorporated in our On-Premises Products as required by the respective Open Source Software licenses. Any Open Source Software that is delivered as part of your Offering and which may not be removed or used separately from the Offering is covered by the warranty, support and indemnification provisions applicable to the Offering. Some of the Open Source Software may have additional terms that apply to the use of the Offering (e.g., the obligation for us to provide attribution of the specific licensor), and those terms will be included in the Documentation; however, these terms will not (a) impose any additional restrictions on your use of the Offering, or (b) negate or amend any of our responsibilities with respect to the Offering.

#### **14. Splunk Developer Tools and Customer Extensions**

Splunk makes Splunk Developer Tools available to you so you can develop Extensions for use with your Purchased Offerings (Extensions that you develop, &quot;**Customer Extensions**&quot;).

You have a nonexclusive, worldwide, nontransferable, nonsublicensable right, subject to the terms of these General Terms, to use Splunk Developer Tools to develop your Customer Extensions, including to support interoperability between the Offering and your system or environment. Splunk proprietary legends or notices contained in the Splunk Developer Tools may not be removed or altered when used in or with your Customer Extension. You retain title to your Customer Extensions, subject to Splunk’s ownership in our Offerings and any materials and technology provided by Splunk in connection with the Splunk Developer Tools. You agree to assume full responsibility for the performance and distribution of Customer Extensions.

#### **15. Third Party Products, Third-Party Extensions, Third-Party Content and Unsupported Splunk Extensions**

A. **Third-Party Extensions on Splunkbase.** Splunk makes Extensions developed and/or made available by a third-party on Splunkbase (&quot;**Third-Party Extension**&quot;) available for download or access as a convenience to its customers. Splunk makes no promises or guarantees related to any Third-Party Extension, including the accuracy, integrity, quality, or security of the Third-Party Extension. Nothing in these General Terms or on Splunkbase will be deemed to be a representation or warranty by Splunk with respect to any Third-Party Extension, even if a particular Third-Party Extension is identified as &quot;certified&quot; or &quot;validated&quot; for use with an Offering. We may, in our reasonable discretion, block or disable access to any Third-Party Extension at any time. Your use of a Third-Party Extension is at your own risk and may be subject to any additional terms, conditions, and policies applicable to that Third-Party Extension (such as license terms, terms of service, or privacy policies of the providers of such Third-Party Extension). Third-Party Extensions may be installed on Hosted Services pursuant to our instructions.

B. **Third Party Content.** Hosted Services may contain features or functions that enable interoperation with Third-Party Content that you, in your sole discretion, choose to add to a Hosted Service. You may be required to obtain access separately to such Third-Party Content from the respective providers, and you may be required to grant Splunk access to your accounts with such providers to the extent necessary for Splunk to allow the interoperation with the Hosted Service. By requesting or allowing Splunk to enable access to such Third-Party Content in connection with the Hosted Services, you certify that you are authorized under the provider’s terms to allow such access. If you install or enable (or direct or otherwise authorize Splunk to install or enable) Third-Party Content for use with a Hosted Service where the interoperation includes access by the third-party provider to your Customer Content, you hereby authorize Splunk to allow the provider of such Third-Party Content to access Customer Content as necessary for the interoperation. You agree that Splunk is not responsible or liable for disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Content resulting from access to Customer Content by such Third-Party Content, nor is Splunk liable for any damages or downtime that you may incur or any impact on your experience of the Hosted Service, directly or indirectly, as a result of your use of and/or reliance upon, any Third-Party Content, sites or resources.

C. **Splunk As a Reseller.** When you purchase third party products (&quot;**Third Party Products**&quot;) from Splunk as specified in an Order (which products shall include third party software, but not any support which Splunk itself has contracted to provide), the following provision applies. Splunk acts solely as a reseller of Third Party Products, which are fulfilled by the relevant third party vendor (&quot;**Third Party Vendor**&quot;), and the purchase and use of Third Party Products is subject solely to the terms, conditions and policies made available by such Third Party Vendor. Consequently, Splunk makes no representation or warranty of any kind regarding the Third Party Products, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, and specifically disclaims all implied terms, conditions and warranties (including as to quality, performance, availability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. You will bring any claim in relation to Third Party Products against the applicable Third Party Vendor directly. In no event will Splunk be liable to you for any claim, loss or damage arising out of the use, operation or availability of Third Party Product (whether such liability arises in contract, negligence, tort, or otherwise).

D. **Unsupported Splunk Extensions.** The Service Level Schedule commitments for any applicable Hosted Services will not apply to Splunk Extensions labeled on Splunkbase as &quot;**Not Supported.**&quot; You agree that Splunk is not responsible for any impact on your experience of a Hosted Service, as a result of your installation and/or use of any &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extensions, and that your sole remedy will be to remove the &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extension from the applicable Hosted Service. Further, some Splunk Extensions may not be compatible or certified for use with that Hosted Service (e.g., only specific Splunk Extensions are validated for our FedRAMP authorized environment for Splunk Cloud Platform). Please refer to the applicable Documentation for more information related to the Splunk Extensions compatible with your specific Purchased Offering.

#### **16. Your Compliance**

A. **Lawful Use of Offerings.** When you access and use an Offering, you are responsible for complying with all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to your access and use. This includes being responsible for your Customer Content and users, for your users’ compliance with these General Terms, and the accuracy, lawful use of, and the means by which you acquired your Customer Content. You may not transmit and/or store PHI Data, PCI Data or ITAR Data within a Hosted Services unless you have specifically purchased a Purchased Offering for that applicable regulated Hosted Services environment (as identified in an Order).

B. **Registration.** You agree to provide accurate and complete information when you register for and use any Offering and agree to keep this information current. Each person who uses any Offering must have a separate username and password. For Hosted Services, you must provide a valid email address for each person authorized to use your Hosted Services, and you may only have one person per username and password. Splunk may reasonably require additional information in connection with certain Offerings (e.g., technical information necessary for your connection to a Hosted Service), and you will provide this information as reasonably requested by Splunk. You are responsible for securing, protecting, and maintaining the confidentiality of your account usernames, passwords and access tokens.

A. **Term and Renewal.** These General Terms will commence upon the Effective Date and will remain in effect until the expiration of all applicable Purchased Offerings, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Section. Termination of a specific Purchased Offering will not affect the Term of any other Purchased Offering. Termination of these General Terms will have the effect of terminating all Purchased Offerings. Grounds for terminating a Purchased Offering (e.g., for non-payment), that are specific to the Purchased Offering, will not be grounds to terminate Purchased Offerings where no breach exists. Unless indicated otherwise in an Order, the Term of a Purchased Offering (and these General Terms) will automatically renew for an additional period of time equal to the length of the preceding Term, unless one party notifies the other of its intent not to renew at least one (1) day in advance of the expiration of the Term or then-current renewal period.

B. **Termination.** Either party may terminate these General Terms, or any Purchased Offering, by written notice to the other party in the event of a material breach of these General Terms, or the specific terms associated with that Purchased Offering, that is not cured within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice.

However, the foregoing limitation will not limit your obligations under the &quot;Payment&quot; section above and will not be deemed to limit your rights to any service level credits under any applicable Service Level Schedule. Furthermore, the cap above will not be deemed to limit Splunk’s right to recover amounts for your use of an Offering in excess of the Capacity purchased or use outside of Internal Business Purposes.**

**In no event will either party or its Affiliates have any liability arising out of or related to these General Terms for any lost profits, revenues, goodwill, or indirect, special, incidental, consequential, cover, business interruption or punitive damages.**

**The limitation of liability herein will not apply to a party’s infringement of the other party’s intellectual property rights, indemnification obligations, or the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of a party.**

**The foregoing disclaimers of damages will also not apply to the extent prohibited by law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. To the extent such a law applies to you, some or all of the exclusions or limitations set forth above may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights.**

9. **Your Assistance**

    Should you report a purported defect or error in an Offering, we may require you to provide us with the following information: (a) a general description of your operating environment; (b) a list of all hardware components, operating systems and networks; (c) a reproducible test case; and (d) any log files, trace and systems files.

We agree to discuss in good faith any condition or requirement you may have for our Personnel that are different from standard policies, however any additional requirement may delay C&I Services and must be vetted and implemented by mutual agreement of the parties and expressly set forth in a Statement of Work. Splunk does not guarantee that it will be able to meet any additional requested requirements.

From time to time, Splunk may collect Usage Data generated as a by-product of your use of Offerings. Usage Data does not include Customer Content.

#### **12. Capacity and Usage Verification**

A. **Certification and Verification.** At Splunk’s request, you will furnish Splunk a certification signed by your authorized representative verifying that your use of the Purchased Offering is in accordance with these General Terms and the applicable Order. For On-Premises Products, we may also ask you from time to time, but not more frequently than once per calendar period, to cooperate with us to verify usage and adherence to purchased Capacities. If Splunk requests a verification process, you agree to provide Splunk reasonable access to the On-Premises Product installed at your facility (or as hosted by your Third-Party Provider). If Splunk does any verification, it will be performed with as little interference as possible to your use of the On-Premises Product and your business operations. Splunk will comply with your (or your Third-Party Providers’) reasonable security procedures.

B. **Overages.** If a verification or usage report reveals that you have exceeded the purchased Capacity or usage rights for your Purchased Offering (e.g., used as a service bureau) during the period reviewed, then we will have the right to invoice you using the applicable Fees at list price then in effect, which will be payable in accordance with these General Terms. Without limiting Splunk’s foregoing rights, with respect to Hosted Services, Splunk may work with you to reduce usage so that it conforms to the applicable usage limit, and we will in good faith discuss options to right size your subscription as appropriate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Splunk will have the right to directly invoice you for overages, regardless of whether you purchased the Purchased Offering from an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace. See the Specific Offering Terms for any additional information related to overages for a Hosted Service.

#### **13. Our Use of Open Source**

Certain Offerings may contain Open Source Software. Splunk makes available in the applicable Documentation a list of Open Source Software incorporated in our On-Premises Products as required by the respective Open Source Software licenses. Any Open Source Software that is delivered as part of your Offering and which may not be removed or used separately from the Offering is covered by the warranty, support and indemnification provisions applicable to the Offering. Some of the Open Source Software may have additional terms that apply to the use of the Offering (e.g., the obligation for us to provide attribution of the specific licensor), and those terms will be included in the Documentation; however, these terms will not (a) impose any additional restrictions on your use of the Offering, or (b) negate or amend any of our responsibilities with respect to the Offering.

#### **14. Splunk Developer Tools and Customer Extensions**

Splunk makes Splunk Developer Tools available to you so you can develop Extensions for use with your Purchased Offerings (Extensions that you develop, &quot;**Customer Extensions**&quot;).

You have a nonexclusive, worldwide, nontransferable, nonsublicensable right, subject to the terms of these General Terms, to use Splunk Developer Tools to develop your Customer Extensions, including to support interoperability between the Offering and your system or environment. Splunk proprietary legends or notices contained in the Splunk Developer Tools may not be removed or altered when used in or with your Customer Extension.

A. **Third-Party Extensions on Splunkbase.** Splunk makes Extensions developed and/or made available by a third-party on Splunkbase (&quot;**Third-Party Extension**&quot;) available for download or access as a convenience to its customers. Splunk makes no promises or guarantees related to any Third-Party Extension, including the accuracy, integrity, quality, or security of the Third-Party Extension. Nothing in these General Terms or on Splunkbase will be deemed to be a representation or warranty by Splunk with respect to any Third-Party Extension, even if a particular Third-Party Extension is identified as &quot;certified&quot; or &quot;validated&quot; for use with an Offering. We may, in our reasonable discretion, block or disable access to any Third-Party Extension at any time. Your use of a Third-Party Extension is at your own risk and may be subject to any additional terms, conditions, and policies applicable to that Third-Party Extension (such as license terms, terms of service, or privacy policies of the providers of such Third-Party Extension). Third-Party Extensions may be installed on Hosted Services pursuant to our instructions.

B. **Third Party Content.** Hosted Services may contain features or functions that enable interoperation with Third-Party Content that you, in your sole discretion, choose to add to a Hosted Service. You may be required to obtain access separately to such Third-Party Content from the respective providers, and you may be required to grant Splunk access to your accounts with such providers to the extent necessary for Splunk to allow the interoperation with the Hosted Service. By requesting or allowing Splunk to enable access to such Third-Party Content in connection with the Hosted Services, you certify that you are authorized under the provider’s terms to allow such access. If you install or enable (or direct or otherwise authorize Splunk to install or enable) Third-Party Content for use with a Hosted Service where the interoperation includes access by the third-party provider to your Customer Content, you hereby authorize Splunk to allow the provider of such Third-Party Content to access Customer Content as necessary for the interoperation. You agree that Splunk is not responsible or liable for disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Content resulting from access to Customer Content by such Third-Party Content, nor is Splunk liable for any damages or downtime that you may incur or any impact on your experience of the Hosted Service, directly or indirectly, as a result of your use of and/or reliance upon, any Third-Party Content, sites or resources.

C. **Splunk As a Reseller.** When you purchase third party products (&quot;**Third Party Products**&quot;) from Splunk as specified in an Order (which products shall include third party software, but not any support which Splunk itself has contracted to provide), the following provision applies. Splunk acts solely as a reseller of Third Party Products, which are fulfilled by the relevant third party vendor (&quot;**Third Party Vendor**&quot;), and the purchase and use of Third Party Products is subject solely to the terms, conditions and policies made available by such Third Party Vendor. Consequently, Splunk makes no representation or warranty of any kind regarding the Third Party Products, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, and specifically disclaims all implied terms, conditions and warranties (including as to quality, performance, availability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. You will bring any claim in relation to Third Party Products against the applicable Third Party Vendor directly. In no event will Splunk be liable to you for any claim, loss or damage arising out of the use, operation or availability of Third Party Product (whether such liability arises in contract, negligence, tort, or otherwise).

D. **Unsupported Splunk Extensions.** The Service Level Schedule commitments for any applicable Hosted Services will not apply to Splunk Extensions labeled on Splunkbase as &quot;**Not Supported.**&quot; You agree that Splunk is not responsible for any impact on your experience of a Hosted Service, as a result of your installation and/or use of any &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extensions, and that your sole remedy will be to remove the &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extension from the applicable Hosted Service. Further, some Splunk Extensions may not be compatible or certified for use with that Hosted Service (e.g., only specific Splunk Extensions are validated for our FedRAMP authorized environment for Splunk Cloud Platform). Please refer to the applicable Documentation for more information related to the Splunk Extensions compatible with your specific Purchased Offering.

B. **Compelled Disclosure of Confidential Information.** Notwithstanding the foregoing terms, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is compelled by law enforcement agencies or regulators to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a Party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to such Confidential Information.

#### **18. Payment**

The payment terms below only apply when you purchase Offerings directly from Splunk. When you purchase from an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, the payment terms are between you and the authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace. However, a breach of your payment obligations for an Offering with a Digital Marketplace will be deemed a breach of this Section 18.

A. **Fees.** You agree to pay all Fees specified in the Orders. Fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except as otherwise expressly set forth in these General Terms.

#### **21. Term and Termination**

A. **Term and Renewal.** These General Terms will commence upon the Effective Date and will remain in effect until the expiration of all applicable Purchased Offerings, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Section. Termination of a specific Purchased Offering will not affect the Term of any other Purchased Offering. Termination of these General Terms will have the effect of terminating all Purchased Offerings. Grounds for terminating a Purchased Offering (e.g., for non-payment), that are specific to the Purchased Offering, will not be grounds to terminate Purchased Offerings where no breach exists. Unless indicated otherwise in an Order, the Term of a Purchased Offering (and these General Terms) will automatically renew for an additional period of time equal to the length of the preceding Term, unless one party notifies the other of its intent not to renew at least one (1) day in advance of the expiration of the Term or then-current renewal period.

B. **Termination.** Either party may terminate these General Terms, or any Purchased Offering, by written notice to the other party in the event of a material breach of these General Terms, or the specific terms associated with that Purchased Offering, that is not cured within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice. Upon any expiration or termination of a Purchased Offering, the rights and licenses granted to you for that Purchased Offering will automatically terminate, and you agree to immediately (i) cease using and accessing the Offering, (ii) return or destroy all copies of any On-Premises Products and other Splunk materials and Splunk Confidential Information in your possession or control, and (iii) upon our request, certify in writing the completion of such return or destruction. Upon termination of these General Terms or any Purchased Offering, Splunk will have no obligation to refund any Fees or other amounts received from you during the Term. Notwithstanding any early termination above, except for your termination for our uncured material breach, you will still be required to pay all Fees payable under an Order.

C. **Survival.** The termination or expiration of these General Terms will not affect any provisions herein which by their nature survive termination or expiration, including the provisions that deal with the following subject matters: definitions, ownership of intellectual property, confidentiality, payment obligations, effect of termination, limitation of liability, privacy, and the &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; section in these General Terms.

D. **Suspension of Service.** In the event of a material breach or threatened material breach of this Agreement, Splunk may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, suspend your use of the Hosted Service until such breach is cured or Splunk reasonably believes there is no longer a threat, provided that, we will give you at least five (5) days’ prior notice before suspension. Suspension of a Hosted Service will have no impact on the duration of the Term of the Purchased Offering, or the associated Fees owed.

#### **22. Limitation of Liability**

**In no event will the aggregate liability of either party, together with any of its Affiliates, arising out of or related to any Purchased Offering exceed the total amount paid by you for that Purchased Offering in the twelve (12) months preceding the first incident out of which the liability arose. However, the foregoing limitation will not limit your obligations under the &quot;Payment&quot; section above and will not be deemed to limit your rights to any service level credits under any applicable Service Level Schedule. Furthermore, the cap above will not be deemed to limit Splunk’s right to recover amounts for your use of an Offering in excess of the Capacity purchased or use outside of Internal Business Purposes.**

**In no event will either party or its Affiliates have any liability arising out of or related to these General Terms for any lost profits, revenues, goodwill, or indirect, special, incidental, consequential, cover, business interruption or punitive damages.**

**The foregoing limitations will apply whether the action is in contract or tort and regardless of the theory of liability, even if a party or its Affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages or if a party’s or its Affiliates’ remedy otherwise fails of its essential purpose.**

**The limitation of liability herein will not apply to a party’s infringement of the other party’s intellectual property rights, indemnification obligations, or the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of a party.**

**The foregoing disclaimers of damages will also not apply to the extent prohibited by law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. To the extent such a law applies to you, some or all of the exclusions or limitations set forth above may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights.**

#### **23. Indemnity**

A. **Our Indemnification to You.** Splunk will defend and indemnify you, and pay all damages (including attorneys’ fees and costs) awarded against you, or that are agreed to in a settlement, to the extent a claim, demand, suit or proceeding is made or brought against you or your Affiliates by a third party (including those brought by a government entity) alleging that a Purchased Offering infringes or misappropriates such third party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (a &quot;**Customer Claim**&quot;). Splunk will have no obligation under the foregoing provision to the extent a Customer Claim arises from your breach of these General Terms, your Customer Content, Third-Party Extension, or the combination of the Offering with: (i) Customer Content; (ii) Third-Party Extensions; (iii) any software other than software provided by Splunk; or (iv) any hardware or equipment. However, Splunk will indemnify against combination claims to the extent (y) the combined software is necessary for the normal operation of the Purchased Offering (e.g., an operating system), or (z) the Purchased Offering provides substantially all the essential elements of the asserted infringement or misappropriation claim. Splunk may in its sole discretion and at no cost to you: (1) modify any Purchased Offering so that it no longer infringes or misappropriates a third party right, (2) obtain a license for your continued use of the Purchased Offering, in accordance with these General Terms, or (3) terminate the Purchased Offering and refund to you any prepaid fees covering the unexpired Term.

B. **Your Indemnification to Us.** Unless expressly prohibited by applicable law, you will defend and indemnify us, and pay all damages (including attorneys’ fees and costs) awarded against Splunk, or that are agreed to in a settlement, to the extent a claim, demand, suit or proceeding is made or brought against Splunk or its Affiliates by a third party (including those brought by a government entity) that: (i) alleges that your Customer Content or Customer Extensions infringes or misappropriates such third party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret, or violates another right of a third party; or (ii) alleges that your Customer Content or your use of any Offering violates applicable law or regulation.

C. **Mutual Indemnity.** Each party will defend, indemnify and pay all damages (including attorneys’ fees and costs) awarded against the other party, or that are agreed to in a settlement to the extent that an action brought against the other party by a third party is based upon a claim for bodily injury (including death) to any person, or damage to tangible property resulting from the negligent acts or willful misconduct of the indemnifying party or its personnel hereunder, and will pay any reasonable, direct, out-of-pocket costs, damages and reasonable attorneys’ fees attributable to such claim that are awarded against the indemnified party (or are payable in settlement by the indemnified party).

D. **Process for Indemnification.** The indemnification obligations above are subject to the party seeking indemnification to: (i) provide the other party with prompt written notice of the specific claim; (ii) give the indemnifying party sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim (except that the indemnifying party may not settle any claim that requires any action or forbearance on the indemnified party’s part without their prior consent, which will not unreasonably withhold or delay); and (iii) gives the indemnifying party all reasonable assistance, at such party’s expense.

#### **24. Updates to Offerings**

Our Offerings and policies may be updated over the course of our relationship. From time to time, Splunk may update or modify an Offering and our policies, provided that: (a) the change and modification applies to all customers generally, and are not targeted to any particular customer; (b) no such change or modification will impose additional fees on you during the applicable Term or additional restrictions on your use of the Offering, (c) no such change will override or supersede the allocation of risk between us under these General Terms, including without limitation the terms under Sections 22 (Limitation of Liability) and 23 (Indemnity); (d) no such change or modification will materially reduce the security protections or overall functionality of the applicable Offering; and (e) any such change or modification will apply only prospectively, and will not apply to any breach or dispute that arose between the parties prior to the effective date of the change or modification. In the event of any conflict between these General Terms and the policies incorporated herein by reference, these General Terms will control.

#### **25. Governing Law**

These General Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, as if performed wholly within the state and without giving effect to the principles of conflict of law. Any legal action or proceeding arising under these General Terms will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the Northern District of California and the parties hereby consent to personal jurisdiction and venue therein. Splunk may seek injunctive or other relief in any state, federal, or national court of competent jurisdiction for any actual or alleged infringement of intellectual property or other proprietary rights of Splunk, its Affiliates, or any third party.

Neither the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act nor the United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods will apply to these General Terms.

F. **Waiver; Severability.** The waiver by either party of a breach of or a default under these General Terms will not be effective unless in writing. The failure by either party to enforce any provisions of these General Terms will not constitute a waiver of any other right hereunder or of any subsequent enforcement of that or any other provisions.

We agree to discuss in good faith any condition or requirement you may have for our Personnel that are different from standard policies, however any additional requirement may delay C&I Services and must be vetted and implemented by mutual agreement of the parties and expressly set forth in a Statement of Work. Splunk does not guarantee that it will be able to meet any additional requested requirements.

If we elect to consider a Change Order Request, then we will promptly notify you if we believe that the Change Order Request requires an adjustment to the fees or to the schedule for the performance of the C&I Services. In such event, the parties will negotiate in good faith a reasonable and equitable adjustment to the fees and/or schedule, as applicable. We will continue to perform C&I Services pursuant to the existing Statement of Work and will have no obligation to perform any Change Order Request unless and until the parties have agreed in writing to such an equitable adjustment.

<ol type="i">
  <li><b>Trials and Evaluations.</b> Offerings provided for trials and evaluations are provided at no charge, and their use will be for a limited duration.</li>
  <li><b>Beta Licenses.</b> Some Offerings and features may be available to you as a preview, or as an alpha, beta or other pre-release version (each, a "<b>Beta Offering</b>"). All rights for Beta Offerings are solely for internal testing and evaluation. Your use of a Beta Offering will be for the term specified by us, and if no term is specified, then for the earlier of one year from the start date of the Beta Offering or when that version of the Beta Offering becomes generally available. We may discontinue the Beta Offering at any time and may decide not to make any of the features and functionality generally available.</li>

At Splunk’s request, you agree: (a) to publish a press release and case study on your use of the Donated Offering; and (b) to be interviewed for the production of a Splunk customer video that will accompany the press release and case study. Splunk will draft and edit all content in collaboration with you and will obtain your edits and written approval (email is sufficient) prior to publication, and such approval will not be unreasonably withheld.

</ol>

#### **2. Purchasing Through Authorized Resellers, Digital Marketplaces, and Splunk Affiliates**

A. **Authorized Resellers and Digital Marketplaces.** If you purchase Offerings through a Splunk authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, these General Terms will govern those Offerings. Your payment obligations for the Purchased Offerings will be with the authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, as applicable, not Splunk. You will have no direct Fee payment obligations to Splunk for those Offerings. However, in the event that you fail to pay the Digital Marketplace for your Purchased Offerings, Splunk retains the right to enforce your payment obligations and collect directly from you.

Any terms agreed to between you and the authorized reseller that are in addition to these General Terms are solely between you and the authorized reseller and Digital Marketplace, as applicable. No agreement between you and an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace is binding on Splunk or will have any force or effect with respect to the rights in, or the operation, use or provision of, the Offerings.

B. **Splunk Affiliate Distributors.** Splunk has appointed certain Splunk Affiliates as its non-exclusive distributors of the Offerings (each, a &quot;**Splunk Affiliate Distributor**&quot;). Each Splunk Affiliate Distributor is authorized by Splunk to negotiate and enter into Orders with Customers. Where a purchase from Splunk is offered by a Splunk Affiliate Distributor, Customer will issue Orders, and make payments, to the Splunk Affiliate Distributor which issued the quote for the Offering. Each Order will be deemed a separate contract between Customer and the relevant Splunk Affiliate Distributor and will be subject to these General Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer agrees that: (i) the total liability of Splunk under these General Terms as set forth in Section 22 (Limitation of Liability) states the overall combined liability of Splunk and Splunk Affiliate Distributors; (ii) the entering into Orders by a Splunk Affiliate Distributor will not be deemed to expand Splunk and its Affiliates’ overall responsibilities or liability under these General Terms; and (iii) Customer will have no right to recover more than once from the same event.

#### **3. Your Contractors and Third-Party Providers**

You may permit your authorized consultants, contractors, and agents (&quot;**Third-Party Providers**&quot;) to access and use your Purchased Offerings, but only on your behalf in connection with providing services to you, and subject to the terms and conditions of these General Terms. Any access or use by a Third-Party Provider will be subject to the same limitations and restrictions that apply to you under these General Terms, and you will be responsible for any Third-Party Provider’s actions relating to their use of the Offering. The aggregate use by you and all of your Third-Party Providers must not exceed the Capacity purchased, and nothing in this Section is intended to or will be deemed to increase such Capacity.

#### **4. Hosted Services and Specific Offering Terms**

A. **Service Levels.** When you purchase Hosted Services as a Purchased Offering, we will make the applicable Hosted Services available to you during the Term in accordance with these General Terms. The Service Level Schedules (as identified in the Specific Offering Terms referenced in Section 4(F) below) and associated remedies will apply to the availability and uptime of the applicable Hosted Service. If applicable, service credits will be available for downtime in accordance with the Service Level Schedule.

You agree to notify Splunk promptly if you believe that an unauthorized third party may be using your accounts or if your account information is lost or stolen.

D. **Refund Upon Termination for Splunk’s Breach.** If a Hosted Service is terminated by you for Splunk’s uncured material breach in accordance with these General Terms, Splunk will refund you any prepaid subscription fees covering the remainder of the Term after the effective date of termination.

E. **Return of Customer Content.** Customer Content may be retrieved by you and removed from the Hosted Services in accordance with the applicable Documentation. We will make the Customer Content available on the Hosted Services for thirty (30) days after termination of a subscription for your retrieval. After that thirty (30) day period, we will have no obligation to maintain the storage of your Customer Content, and you hereby authorize us thereafter to, and we will, unless legally prohibited, delete all remaining Customer Content. If you require assistance in connection with migration of your Customer Content, depending on the nature of the request, we may require a mutually agreed upon fee for assistance.

F. **Specific Offering Terms.** Specific security controls and certifications, data policies, service descriptions, Service Level Schedules and other terms specific to a Hosted Service and other Offerings (&quot;**Specific Offering Terms**&quot;) are set forth here: [www.splunk.com/SpecificTerms](www.splunk.com/SpecificTerms), and will apply, and be deemed incorporated herein by reference.

#### **11. Usage Data**

From time to time, Splunk may collect Usage Data generated as a by-product of your use of Offerings. Usage Data does not include Customer Content.

#### **12. Capacity and Usage Verification**

A. **Certification and Verification.** At Splunk’s request, you will furnish Splunk a certification signed by your authorized representative verifying that your use of the Purchased Offering is in accordance with these General Terms and the applicable Order. For On-Premises Products, we may also ask you from time to time, but not more frequently than once per calendar period, to cooperate with us to verify usage and adherence to purchased Capacities. If Splunk requests a verification process, you agree to provide Splunk reasonable access to the On-Premises Product installed at your facility (or as hosted by your Third-Party Provider). If Splunk does any verification, it will be performed with as little interference as possible to your use of the On-Premises Product and your business operations. Splunk will comply with your (or your Third-Party Providers’) reasonable security procedures.

B. **Overages.** If a verification or usage report reveals that you have exceeded the purchased Capacity or usage rights for your Purchased Offering (e.g., used as a service bureau) during the period reviewed, then we will have the right to invoice you using the applicable Fees at list price then in effect, which will be payable in accordance with these General Terms. Without limiting Splunk’s foregoing rights, with respect to Hosted Services, Splunk may work with you to reduce usage so that it conforms to the applicable usage limit, and we will in good faith discuss options to right size your subscription as appropriate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Splunk will have the right to directly invoice you for overages, regardless of whether you purchased the Purchased Offering from an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace. See the Specific Offering Terms for any additional information related to overages for a Hosted Service.

#### **13. Our Use of Open Source**

Certain Offerings may contain Open Source Software. Splunk makes available in the applicable Documentation a list of Open Source Software incorporated in our On-Premises Products as required by the respective Open Source Software licenses. Any Open Source Software that is delivered as part of your Offering and which may not be removed or used separately from the Offering is covered by the warranty, support and indemnification provisions applicable to the Offering. Some of the Open Source Software may have additional terms that apply to the use of the Offering (e.g., the obligation for us to provide attribution of the specific licensor), and those terms will be included in the Documentation; however, these terms will not (a) impose any additional restrictions on your use of the Offering, or (b) negate or amend any of our responsibilities with respect to the Offering.

#### **14. Splunk Developer Tools and Customer Extensions**

Splunk makes Splunk Developer Tools available to you so you can develop Extensions for use with your Purchased Offerings (Extensions that you develop, &quot;**Customer Extensions**&quot;).

You have a nonexclusive, worldwide, nontransferable, nonsublicensable right, subject to the terms of these General Terms, to use Splunk Developer Tools to develop your Customer Extensions, including to support interoperability between the Offering and your system or environment. Splunk proprietary legends or notices contained in the Splunk Developer Tools may not be removed or altered when used in or with your Customer Extension. You retain title to your Customer Extensions, subject to Splunk’s ownership in our Offerings and any materials and technology provided by Splunk in connection with the Splunk Developer Tools. You agree to assume full responsibility for the performance and distribution of Customer Extensions.

#### **15. Third Party Products, Third-Party Extensions, Third-Party Content and Unsupported Splunk Extensions**

A. **Third-Party Extensions on Splunkbase.** Splunk makes Extensions developed and/or made available by a third-party on Splunkbase (&quot;**Third-Party Extension**&quot;) available for download or access as a convenience to its customers. Splunk makes no promises or guarantees related to any Third-Party Extension, including the accuracy, integrity, quality, or security of the Third-Party Extension. Nothing in these General Terms or on Splunkbase will be deemed to be a representation or warranty by Splunk with respect to any Third-Party Extension, even if a particular Third-Party Extension is identified as &quot;certified&quot; or &quot;validated&quot; for use with an Offering. We may, in our reasonable discretion, block or disable access to any Third-Party Extension at any time. Your use of a Third-Party Extension is at your own risk and may be subject to any additional terms, conditions, and policies applicable to that Third-Party Extension (such as license terms, terms of service, or privacy policies of the providers of such Third-Party Extension). Third-Party Extensions may be installed on Hosted Services pursuant to our instructions.

B. **Third Party Content.** Hosted Services may contain features or functions that enable interoperation with Third-Party Content that you, in your sole discretion, choose to add to a Hosted Service. You may be required to obtain access separately to such Third-Party Content from the respective providers, and you may be required to grant Splunk access to your accounts with such providers to the extent necessary for Splunk to allow the interoperation with the Hosted Service. By requesting or allowing Splunk to enable access to such Third-Party Content in connection with the Hosted Services, you certify that you are authorized under the provider’s terms to allow such access. If you install or enable (or direct or otherwise authorize Splunk to install or enable) Third-Party Content for use with a Hosted Service where the interoperation includes access by the third-party provider to your Customer Content, you hereby authorize Splunk to allow the provider of such Third-Party Content to access Customer Content as necessary for the interoperation. You agree that Splunk is not responsible or liable for disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Content resulting from access to Customer Content by such Third-Party Content, nor is Splunk liable for any damages or downtime that you may incur or any impact on your experience of the Hosted Service, directly or indirectly, as a result of your use of and/or reliance upon, any Third-Party Content, sites or resources.

C. **Splunk As a Reseller.** When you purchase third party products (&quot;**Third Party Products**&quot;) from Splunk as specified in an Order (which products shall include third party software, but not any support which Splunk itself has contracted to provide), the following provision applies. Splunk acts solely as a reseller of Third Party Products, which are fulfilled by the relevant third party vendor (&quot;**Third Party Vendor**&quot;), and the purchase and use of Third Party Products is subject solely to the terms, conditions and policies made available by such Third Party Vendor. Consequently, Splunk makes no representation or warranty of any kind regarding the Third Party Products, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, and specifically disclaims all implied terms, conditions and warranties (including as to quality, performance, availability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. You will bring any claim in relation to Third Party Products against the applicable Third Party Vendor directly. In no event will Splunk be liable to you for any claim, loss or damage arising out of the use, operation or availability of Third Party Product (whether such liability arises in contract, negligence, tort, or otherwise).

D. **Unsupported Splunk Extensions.** The Service Level Schedule commitments for any applicable Hosted Services will not apply to Splunk Extensions labeled on Splunkbase as &quot;**Not Supported.**&quot; You agree that Splunk is not responsible for any impact on your experience of a Hosted Service, as a result of your installation and/or use of any &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extensions, and that your sole remedy will be to remove the &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extension from the applicable Hosted Service. Further, some Splunk Extensions may not be compatible or certified for use with that Hosted Service (e.g., only specific Splunk Extensions are validated for our FedRAMP authorized environment for Splunk Cloud Platform). Please refer to the applicable Documentation for more information related to the Splunk Extensions compatible with your specific Purchased Offering.

#### **16. Your Compliance**

A. **Lawful Use of Offerings.** When you access and use an Offering, you are responsible for complying with all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to your access and use. This includes being responsible for your Customer Content and users, for your users’ compliance with these General Terms, and the accuracy, lawful use of, and the means by which you acquired your Customer Content.

You are responsible for verifying that any user accessing Customer Content in the Hosted Services in the AWS GovCloud (US) region is eligible to access such Customer Content. The Hosted Services in the AWS GovCloud (US) region may not be used to process or store classified data. You will be responsible for all sanitization costs incurred by Splunk if users introduce classified data into the Hosted Services in the AWS GovCloud (US) region. You may be required to execute additional addendums to this agreement prior to provisioning of selected Hosted Services.

#### **17. Confidentiality**

A. **Confidential Information.** Each party will protect the Confidential Information of the other.

B. **Compelled Disclosure of Confidential Information.** Notwithstanding the foregoing terms, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is compelled by law enforcement agencies or regulators to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a Party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to such Confidential Information.

#### **18. Payment**

The payment terms below only apply when you purchase Offerings directly from Splunk. When you purchase from an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, the payment terms are between you and the authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace. However, a breach of your payment obligations for an Offering with a Digital Marketplace will be deemed a breach of this Section 18.

A. **Fees.** You agree to pay all Fees specified in the Orders. Fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except as otherwise expressly set forth in these General Terms. Without limiting any of our other rights or remedies herein, overdue charges may accrue interest monthly at the rate of 1.5% of the then-outstanding unpaid balance, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower.

#### **21. Term and Termination**

A. **Term and Renewal.** These General Terms will commence upon the Effective Date and will remain in effect until the expiration of all applicable Purchased Offerings, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Section. Termination of a specific Purchased Offering will not affect the Term of any other Purchased Offering. Termination of these General Terms will have the effect of terminating all Purchased Offerings. Grounds for terminating a Purchased Offering (e.g., for non-payment), that are specific to the Purchased Offering, will not be grounds to terminate Purchased Offerings where no breach exists. Unless indicated otherwise in an Order, the Term of a Purchased Offering (and these General Terms) will automatically renew for an additional period of time equal to the length of the preceding Term, unless one party notifies the other of its intent not to renew at least one (1) day in advance of the expiration of the Term or then-current renewal period.

B. **Termination.** Either party may terminate these General Terms, or any Purchased Offering, by written notice to the other party in the event of a material breach of these General Terms, or the specific terms associated with that Purchased Offering, that is not cured within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice. Upon any expiration or termination of a Purchased Offering, the rights and licenses granted to you for that Purchased Offering will automatically terminate, and you agree to immediately (i) cease using and accessing the Offering, (ii) return or destroy all copies of any On-Premises Products and other Splunk materials and Splunk Confidential Information in your possession or control, and (iii) upon our request, certify in writing the completion of such return or destruction. Upon termination of these General Terms or any Purchased Offering, Splunk will have no obligation to refund any Fees or other amounts received from you during the Term. Notwithstanding any early termination above, except for your termination for our uncured material breach, you will still be required to pay all Fees payable under an Order.

C. **Survival.** The termination or expiration of these General Terms will not affect any provisions herein which by their nature survive termination or expiration, including the provisions that deal with the following subject matters: definitions, ownership of intellectual property, confidentiality, payment obligations, effect of termination, limitation of liability, privacy, and the &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; section in these General Terms.

D. **Suspension of Service.** In the event of a material breach or threatened material breach of this Agreement, Splunk may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, suspend your use of the Hosted Service until such breach is cured or Splunk reasonably believes there is no longer a threat, provided that, we will give you at least five (5) days’ prior notice before suspension. Suspension of a Hosted Service will have no impact on the duration of the Term of the Purchased Offering, or the associated Fees owed.

#### **22. Limitation of Liability**

**In no event will the aggregate liability of either party, together with any of its Affiliates, arising out of or related to any Purchased Offering exceed the total amount paid by you for that Purchased Offering in the twelve (12) months preceding the first incident out of which the liability arose. However, the foregoing limitation will not limit your obligations under the &quot;Payment&quot; section above and will not be deemed to limit your rights to any service level credits under any applicable Service Level Schedule. Furthermore, the cap above will not be deemed to limit Splunk’s right to recover amounts for your use of an Offering in excess of the Capacity purchased or use outside of Internal Business Purposes.**

**In no event will either party or its Affiliates have any liability arising out of or related to these General Terms for any lost profits, revenues, goodwill, or indirect, special, incidental, consequential, cover, business interruption or punitive damages.**

**The foregoing limitations will apply whether the action is in contract or tort and regardless of the theory of liability, even if a party or its Affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages or if a party’s or its Affiliates’ remedy otherwise fails of its essential purpose.**

**The limitation of liability herein will not apply to a party’s infringement of the other party’s intellectual property rights, indemnification obligations, or the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of a party.**

**The foregoing disclaimers of damages will also not apply to the extent prohibited by law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. To the extent such a law applies to you, some or all of the exclusions or limitations set forth above may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights.**

#### **23. Indemnity**

A. **Our Indemnification to You.** Splunk will defend and indemnify you, and pay all damages (including attorneys’ fees and costs) awarded against you, or that are agreed to in a settlement, to the extent a claim, demand, suit or proceeding is made or brought against you or your Affiliates by a third party (including those brought by a government entity) alleging that a Purchased Offering infringes or misappropriates such third party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (a &quot;**Customer Claim**&quot;).

C. **Mutual Indemnity.** Each party will defend, indemnify and pay all damages (including attorneys’ fees and costs) awarded against the other party, or that are agreed to in a settlement to the extent that an action brought against the other party by a third party is based upon a claim for bodily injury (including death) to any person, or damage to tangible property resulting from the negligent acts or willful misconduct of the indemnifying party or its personnel hereunder, and will pay any reasonable, direct, out-of-pocket costs, damages and reasonable attorneys’ fees attributable to such claim that are awarded against the indemnified party (or are payable in settlement by the indemnified party).

D. **Process for Indemnification.** The indemnification obligations above are subject to the party seeking indemnification to: (i) provide the other party with prompt written notice of the specific claim; (ii) give the indemnifying party sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim (except that the indemnifying party may not settle any claim that requires any action or forbearance on the indemnified party’s part without their prior consent, which will not unreasonably withhold or delay); and (iii) gives the indemnifying party all reasonable assistance, at such party’s expense.

    C. **Use of Subcontractors.** We reserve the right to use subcontractors in performance of the C&I Services, provided: (a) any subcontractor we use meets the requirements herein and conditions of these General Terms and the Statement of Work; (b) we will be responsible for the subcontractor’s compliance with the terms herein and the Statement of Work; and (c) upon your request or inquiry, we will identify any subcontractor that we are using, or plan to use, for C&I Services, and will cooperate in good faith to provide you with all relevant information regarding such subcontractors.

    D. **No Employee Benefits.** We acknowledge and agree that our Personnel are not eligible for or entitled to receive any compensation, benefits, or other incidents of employment that you make available to your employees. We are solely responsible for all employment related taxes, expenses, withholdings, and other similar statutory obligations arising out of the relationship between us and our Personnel and the performance of C&I Services by such Personnel.

3. **Our Background Checks, Security and Compliance Obligations**

    A. **Compliance with Your Security Program.** While on your premises, our Personnel will comply with your security practices and procedures generally prescribed by you for onsite visitors and service providers. However, any requirement that is in addition to the compliance requirements set forth in this Schedule (e.g., background checks that are different from the background checks described herein) must be expressly set forth in a Statement of Work. We agree to discuss in good faith any condition or requirement you may have for our Personnel that are different from standard policies, however any additional requirement may delay C&I Services and must be vetted and implemented by mutual agreement of the parties and expressly set forth in a Statement of Work. Splunk does not guarantee that it will be able to meet any additional requested requirements.

    B. **Our Security Practices.** We implement and follow an enterprise security program, with the policies, plans, and procedures set forth here [www.splunk.com/prof-serv-isa](www.splunk.com/prof-serv-isa). Our Personnel will be subject to the data protection and confidentiality obligations set forth in these General Terms with respect to any of your data that we may have access to in connection with the C&I Services.

    C. **Background Checks.** For U.S.-based projects, we will not assign an employee to perform C&I Services under a Statement of Work unless we have run the following background check on the employee: Criminal Felony & Misdemeanor; SSN Validation; Federal Criminal; SSN Trace; Employment Report – Three (3) Employers; Education Report – One (1) Institution; Global Sanctions & Enforcement; Prohibited Parties; Widescreen Plus National Criminal Search.

    D. **Permissions for Access.** In the event you require any Personnel to sign any waivers, releases, or other documents as a condition to gain access to your premises for performance of the C&I Services (&quot;**Access Documents**&quot;), you agree: (a) that Personnel who will be required to sign Access Documents will sign on behalf of Splunk; (b) that any additional or conflicting terms in Access Documents with these General Terms will have no effect; and (c) you will pursue any claims for breach of any terms in the Access Documents against Splunk and not the individual signing.

4. **Your Materials**

    We will have no rights in or to any Customer Materials, however you grant us the right to use Customer Materials in order to provide the C&I Services. Nothing in these General Terms will deemed to transfer to us any ownership of Customer Materials.

5. **C&I Services Materials and Customizations Unique to You**

    A. **C&I Services Materials.** The C&I Services we perform (e.g., configuration of our Offerings), and the C&I Services Materials we offer, create, and deliver to you in connection with the C&I Services, are generally applicable to our business, and therefore we require the right to be able to re-use the C&I Services Materials we create for one customer in connection with all of our customers. For the avoidance of doubt, our use of the C&I Services Materials created for you in connection with C&I Services will comply with our ongoing obligations and restrictions with respect to your Customer Materials and your Confidential Information, and we will not identify you in any way in connection with our further use of such C&I Services Materials.

    B. **Customer Owned Work Product.** However, in the unlikely event that the parties agree that C&I Services Materials for a project are custom work product unique to your business, and not applicable to other customers generally, we will transfer ownership to those agreed C&I Services Materials to you under the applicable Statement of Work. C&I Services Materials must be expressly identified as &quot;**Customer Owned Work Product**&quot; under a Statement of Work for ownership to pass to you. Subject to payment of applicable Fees under the Statement of Work, we hereby assign to you all rights, title and interest (including all Intellectual Property Rights therein) in and to all C&I Services Materials identified as Customer Owned Work Product (but excluding all Splunk Preexisting IP incorporated into the Customer Owned Work Product). At your request and expense, we will assist and cooperate with you in all reasonable respects and will execute documents and take such further acts reasonably requested by you to enable you to acquire, transfer, maintain, perfect, and enforce your ownership rights in such Customer Owned Work Product.

    C. **Our Ownership.** Subject to your ownership rights in Customer Owned Work Product and Customer Materials, we will own all rights in and to all C&I Services Materials.

    D. **License Rights.** For those C&I Services Materials that are not Customer Owned Work Product, you will have the right to access and use those C&I Services Materials in connection with your applicable Offerings, and those rights will be of the same scope and duration as your rights to the underlying Offering.

6. **C&I Services Warranty**

    We warrant that the C&I Services will be performed in a good and workmanlike manner consistent with applicable industry standards. This warranty will be in effect for a period of thirty (30) days from the completion of any C&I Services. As your sole and exclusive remedy and our entire liability for any breach of the foregoing warranty, we will, at our option and expense, promptly re-perform any C&I Services that fail to meet this warranty or refund to you the fees paid for the non-conforming C&I Services.

7. **Your Cooperation**

9. **Change Order Process**

    You may submit written requests to us to change the scope of C&I Services described in a Statement of Work (each such request, a &quot;**Change Order Request**&quot;). If we elect to consider a Change Order Request, then we will promptly notify you if we believe that the Change Order Request requires an adjustment to the fees or to the schedule for the performance of the C&I Services. In such event, the parties will negotiate in good faith a reasonable and equitable adjustment to the fees and/or schedule, as applicable. We will continue to perform C&I Services pursuant to the existing Statement of Work and will have no obligation to perform any Change Order Request unless and until the parties have agreed in writing to such an equitable adjustment.

10. **Expenses**

    Unless otherwise specified in the Statement of Work, we will not charge you for our expenses we incur in connection with a Statement of Work. Our daily C&I Services rates are inclusive of any expenses. In the event the parties agree that expenses are reimbursable under a Statement of Work, we will mutually agree on any travel policy and any required documentation for reimbursement.

11. **Prepaid C&I Services**

    Unless otherwise expressly stated in a Statement of Work, all prepaid C&I Services must be redeemed within twelve (12) months from the date of purchase/invoice.

          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices

    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
    the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
    as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# **SPLUNK GENERAL TERMS**

Last Updated: February 10, 2023

These Splunk General Terms (&quot;General Terms&quot;) between Splunk Inc., a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business at 270 Brannan Street, San Francisco, California 94107, U.S.A (&quot;Splunk&quot; or &quot;we&quot; or &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) and you (&quot;Customer&quot; or &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) apply to the purchase of licenses and subscriptions for Splunk’s Offerings. By clicking on the appropriate button, or by downloading, installing, accessing or using the Offerings, you agree to these General Terms. If you are entering into these General Terms on behalf of Customer, you represent that you have the authority to bind Customer. If you do not agree to these General Terms, or if you are not authorized to accept the General Terms on behalf of the Customer, do not download, install, access, or use any of the Offerings.

**See the General Terms Definitions Exhibit attached for definitions of capitalized terms not defined herein.**

#### **1. License Rights**

A. **General Rights.** You have the nonexclusive, worldwide, nontransferable and nonsublicensable right, subject to payment of applicable Fees and compliance with the terms of these General Terms, to use your Purchased Offerings for your Internal Business Purposes during the Term and up to the Capacity purchased.

B. **Copies for On-Premise Products.** You have the right to make a reasonable number of copies of On-Premises Products for archival and back-up purposes.

C. **Splunk Extensions.** You may use Splunk Extensions solely in connection with the applicable Purchased Offering subject to the same terms and conditions for that Offering (including with respect to Term) and payment of any Fees associated with the Splunk Extensions. Some Splunk Extensions may be made available under license terms that provide broader rights than the license rights you have to the applicable underlying Offering (e.g., if the Extension is Open Source Software). These broader rights will apply to that Splunk Extension. Splunk Extensions may be installed on Hosted Services pursuant to our instructions.

D. **Trials, Evaluations, Beta and Free Licenses.**

<ol type="i">
  <li><b>Trials and Evaluations.</b> Offerings provided for trials and evaluations are provided at no charge, and their use will be for a limited duration.</li>
  <li><b>Beta Licenses.</b> Some Offerings and features may be available to you as a preview, or as an alpha, beta or other pre-release version (each, a "<b>Beta Offering</b>"). All rights for Beta Offerings are solely for internal testing and evaluation. Your use of a Beta Offering will be for the term specified by us, and if no term is specified, then for the earlier of one year from the start date of the Beta Offering or when that version of the Beta Offering becomes generally available. We may discontinue the Beta Offering at any time and may decide not to make any of the features and functionality generally available.</li>
  <li><b>Free Licenses.</b> From time to time, we may make certain Offerings available for full use (i.e., not subject to limited evaluation purposes) at no charge. These free Offerings may have limited features, functions, and other technical limitations.</li>
  <li><b>Donated Offerings.</b> Donated Offerings are free limited Offerings donated to qualifying Nonprofits under a Splunk donation program. By procuring and making use of a Donated Offering, you hereby represent and warrant that you are a lawfully organized Nonprofit, and you agree to provide verification of your nonprofit status to Splunk upon request. At Splunk’s request, you agree: (a) to publish a press release and case study on your use of the Donated Offering; and (b) to be interviewed for the production of a Splunk customer video that will accompany the press release and case study. Splunk will draft and edit all content in collaboration with you and will obtain your edits and written approval (email is sufficient) prior to publication, and such approval will not be unreasonably withheld. You will allow Splunk to reference your Nonprofit and leading spokespeople in press releases with your written approval (email is sufficient). Splunk may use your name and logo on sales presentations, websites, and other marketing collateral without your prior approval.</li>
 <li><b>Test and Development Licenses.</b> For Offerings identified as "<b>Test and Development</b>" Offerings on your Order, you only have the right to use those Offerings up to the applicable Capacity on a non-production system for non-production uses, including product migration testing or pre-production staging, or testing new data sources, types, or use cases. Test and Development Offerings may not be used for any revenue generation, commercial activity, or other productive business or purpose.</li>
<li><b>Limitations.</b> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these General Terms, we do not provide maintenance and support, warranties, service level commitments, or indemnification for Test and Development Offerings, trials, evaluations, or free or Beta Offerings.</li>
</ol>

#### **2. Purchasing Through Authorized Resellers, Digital Marketplaces, and Splunk Affiliates**

A. **Authorized Resellers and Digital Marketplaces.** If you purchase Offerings through a Splunk authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, these General Terms will govern those Offerings. Your payment obligations for the Purchased Offerings will be with the authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, as applicable, not Splunk. You will have no direct Fee payment obligations to Splunk for those Offerings. However, in the event that you fail to pay the Digital Marketplace for your Purchased Offerings, Splunk retains the right to enforce your payment obligations and collect directly from you.

Any terms agreed to between you and the authorized reseller that are in addition to these General Terms are solely between you and the authorized reseller and Digital Marketplace, as applicable. No agreement between you and an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace is binding on Splunk or will have any force or effect with respect to the rights in, or the operation, use or provision of, the Offerings.

B. **Splunk Affiliate Distributors.** Splunk has appointed certain Splunk Affiliates as its non-exclusive distributors of the Offerings (each, a &quot;**Splunk Affiliate Distributor**&quot;). Each Splunk Affiliate Distributor is authorized by Splunk to negotiate and enter into Orders with Customers. Where a purchase from Splunk is offered by a Splunk Affiliate Distributor, Customer will issue Orders, and make payments, to the Splunk Affiliate Distributor which issued the quote for the Offering. Each Order will be deemed a separate contract between Customer and the relevant Splunk Affiliate Distributor and will be subject to these General Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer agrees that: (i) the total liability of Splunk under these General Terms as set forth in Section 22 (Limitation of Liability) states the overall combined liability of Splunk and Splunk Affiliate Distributors; (ii) the entering into Orders by a Splunk Affiliate Distributor will not be deemed to expand Splunk and its Affiliates’ overall responsibilities or liability under these General Terms; and (iii) Customer will have no right to recover more than once from the same event.

#### **3. Your Contractors and Third-Party Providers**

You may permit your authorized consultants, contractors, and agents (&quot;**Third-Party Providers**&quot;) to access and use your Purchased Offerings, but only on your behalf in connection with providing services to you, and subject to the terms and conditions of these General Terms. Any access or use by a Third-Party Provider will be subject to the same limitations and restrictions that apply to you under these General Terms, and you will be responsible for any Third-Party Provider’s actions relating to their use of the Offering. The aggregate use by you and all of your Third-Party Providers must not exceed the Capacity purchased, and nothing in this Section is intended to or will be deemed to increase such Capacity.

Splunk categorizes product vulnerabilities in accordance with the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (&quot;Medium,&quot; &quot;High,&quot; or &quot;Critical&quot;) and uses commercially reasonable efforts to remediate vulnerabilities depending on their severity level in accordance with industry standards.

#### **12. Capacity and Usage Verification**

A. **Certification and Verification.** At Splunk’s request, you will furnish Splunk a certification signed by your authorized representative verifying that your use of the Purchased Offering is in accordance with these General Terms and the applicable Order. For On-Premises Products, we may also ask you from time to time, but not more frequently than once per calendar period, to cooperate with us to verify usage and adherence to purchased Capacities. If Splunk requests a verification process, you agree to provide Splunk reasonable access to the On-Premises Product installed at your facility (or as hosted by your Third-Party Provider). If Splunk does any verification, it will be performed with as little interference as possible to your use of the On-Premises Product and your business operations. Splunk will comply with your (or your Third-Party Providers’) reasonable security procedures.

B. **Overages.** If a verification or usage report reveals that you have exceeded the purchased Capacity or usage rights for your Purchased Offering (e.g., used as a service bureau) during the period reviewed, then we will have the right to invoice you using the applicable Fees at list price then in effect, which will be payable in accordance with these General Terms. Without limiting Splunk’s foregoing rights, with respect to Hosted Services, Splunk may work with you to reduce usage so that it conforms to the applicable usage limit, and we will in good faith discuss options to right size your subscription as appropriate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Splunk will have the right to directly invoice you for overages, regardless of whether you purchased the Purchased Offering from an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace. See the Specific Offering Terms for any additional information related to overages for a Hosted Service.

#### **13. Our Use of Open Source**

Certain Offerings may contain Open Source Software. Splunk makes available in the applicable Documentation a list of Open Source Software incorporated in our On-Premises Products as required by the respective Open Source Software licenses. Any Open Source Software that is delivered as part of your Offering and which may not be removed or used separately from the Offering is covered by the warranty, support and indemnification provisions applicable to the Offering. Some of the Open Source Software may have additional terms that apply to the use of the Offering (e.g., the obligation for us to provide attribution of the specific licensor), and those terms will be included in the Documentation; however, these terms will not (a) impose any additional restrictions on your use of the Offering, or (b) negate or amend any of our responsibilities with respect to the Offering.

A. **Third-Party Extensions on Splunkbase.** Splunk makes Extensions developed and/or made available by a third-party on Splunkbase (&quot;**Third-Party Extension**&quot;) available for download or access as a convenience to its customers. Splunk makes no promises or guarantees related to any Third-Party Extension, including the accuracy, integrity, quality, or security of the Third-Party Extension. Nothing in these General Terms or on Splunkbase will be deemed to be a representation or warranty by Splunk with respect to any Third-Party Extension, even if a particular Third-Party Extension is identified as &quot;certified&quot; or &quot;validated&quot; for use with an Offering. We may, in our reasonable discretion, block or disable access to any Third-Party Extension at any time. Your use of a Third-Party Extension is at your own risk and may be subject to any additional terms, conditions, and policies applicable to that Third-Party Extension (such as license terms, terms of service, or privacy policies of the providers of such Third-Party Extension). Third-Party Extensions may be installed on Hosted Services pursuant to our instructions.

B. **Third Party Content.** Hosted Services may contain features or functions that enable interoperation with Third-Party Content that you, in your sole discretion, choose to add to a Hosted Service. You may be required to obtain access separately to such Third-Party Content from the respective providers, and you may be required to grant Splunk access to your accounts with such providers to the extent necessary for Splunk to allow the interoperation with the Hosted Service. By requesting or allowing Splunk to enable access to such Third-Party Content in connection with the Hosted Services, you certify that you are authorized under the provider’s terms to allow such access. If you install or enable (or direct or otherwise authorize Splunk to install or enable) Third-Party Content for use with a Hosted Service where the interoperation includes access by the third-party provider to your Customer Content, you hereby authorize Splunk to allow the provider of such Third-Party Content to access Customer Content as necessary for the interoperation. You agree that Splunk is not responsible or liable for disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Content resulting from access to Customer Content by such Third-Party Content, nor is Splunk liable for any damages or downtime that you may incur or any impact on your experience of the Hosted Service, directly or indirectly, as a result of your use of and/or reliance upon, any Third-Party Content, sites or resources.

C. **Splunk As a Reseller.** When you purchase third party products (&quot;**Third Party Products**&quot;) from Splunk as specified in an Order (which products shall include third party software, but not any support which Splunk itself has contracted to provide), the following provision applies. Splunk acts solely as a reseller of Third Party Products, which are fulfilled by the relevant third party vendor (&quot;**Third Party Vendor**&quot;), and the purchase and use of Third Party Products is subject solely to the terms, conditions and policies made available by such Third Party Vendor. Consequently, Splunk makes no representation or warranty of any kind regarding the Third Party Products, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, and specifically disclaims all implied terms, conditions and warranties (including as to quality, performance, availability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. You will bring any claim in relation to Third Party Products against the applicable Third Party Vendor directly. In no event will Splunk be liable to you for any claim, loss or damage arising out of the use, operation or availability of Third Party Product (whether such liability arises in contract, negligence, tort, or otherwise).

D. **Unsupported Splunk Extensions.** The Service Level Schedule commitments for any applicable Hosted Services will not apply to Splunk Extensions labeled on Splunkbase as &quot;**Not Supported.**&quot; You agree that Splunk is not responsible for any impact on your experience of a Hosted Service, as a result of your installation and/or use of any &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extensions, and that your sole remedy will be to remove the &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extension from the applicable Hosted Service. Further, some Splunk Extensions may not be compatible or certified for use with that Hosted Service (e.g., only specific Splunk Extensions are validated for our FedRAMP authorized environment for Splunk Cloud Platform). Please refer to the applicable Documentation for more information related to the Splunk Extensions compatible with your specific Purchased Offering.

The Hosted Services in the AWS GovCloud (US) region may not be used to process or store classified data. You will be responsible for all sanitization costs incurred by Splunk if users introduce classified data into the Hosted Services in the AWS GovCloud (US) region. You may be required to execute additional addendums to this agreement prior to provisioning of selected Hosted Services.

A. **Confidential Information.** Each party will protect the Confidential Information of the other.

B. **Compelled Disclosure of Confidential Information.** Notwithstanding the foregoing terms, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is compelled by law enforcement agencies or regulators to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a Party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to such Confidential Information.

#### **18. Payment**

The payment terms below only apply when you purchase Offerings directly from Splunk. When you purchase from an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, the payment terms are between you and the authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace. However, a breach of your payment obligations for an Offering with a Digital Marketplace will be deemed a breach of this Section 18.

A. **Fees.** You agree to pay all Fees specified in the Orders. Fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except as otherwise expressly set forth in these General Terms. Without limiting any of our other rights or remedies herein, overdue charges may accrue interest monthly at the rate of 1.5% of the then-outstanding unpaid balance, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower.

#### **19. Splunk’s Warranties**

#### **21. Term and Termination**

A. **Term and Renewal.** These General Terms will commence upon the Effective Date and will remain in effect until the expiration of all applicable Purchased Offerings, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Section. Termination of a specific Purchased Offering will not affect the Term of any other Purchased Offering. Termination of these General Terms will have the effect of terminating all Purchased Offerings. Grounds for terminating a Purchased Offering (e.g., for non-payment), that are specific to the Purchased Offering, will not be grounds to terminate Purchased Offerings where no breach exists. Unless indicated otherwise in an Order, the Term of a Purchased Offering (and these General Terms) will automatically renew for an additional period of time equal to the length of the preceding Term, unless one party notifies the other of its intent not to renew at least one (1) day in advance of the expiration of the Term or then-current renewal period.

B. **Termination.** Either party may terminate these General Terms, or any Purchased Offering, by written notice to the other party in the event of a material breach of these General Terms, or the specific terms associated with that Purchased Offering, that is not cured within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice. Upon any expiration or termination of a Purchased Offering, the rights and licenses granted to you for that Purchased Offering will automatically terminate, and you agree to immediately (i) cease using and accessing the Offering, (ii) return or destroy all copies of any On-Premises Products and other Splunk materials and Splunk Confidential Information in your possession or control, and (iii) upon our request, certify in writing the completion of such return or destruction. Upon termination of these General Terms or any Purchased Offering, Splunk will have no obligation to refund any Fees or other amounts received from you during the Term. Notwithstanding any early termination above, except for your termination for our uncured material breach, you will still be required to pay all Fees payable under an Order.

C. **Survival.** The termination or expiration of these General Terms will not affect any provisions herein which by their nature survive termination or expiration, including the provisions that deal with the following subject matters: definitions, ownership of intellectual property, confidentiality, payment obligations, effect of termination, limitation of liability, privacy, and the &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; section in these General Terms.

D. **Suspension of Service.** In the event of a material breach or threatened material breach of this Agreement, Splunk may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, suspend your use of the Hosted Service until such breach is cured or Splunk reasonably believes there is no longer a threat, provided that, we will give you at least five (5) days’ prior notice before suspension. Suspension of a Hosted Service will have no impact on the duration of the Term of the Purchased Offering, or the associated Fees owed.

#### **22. Limitation of Liability**

**In no event will the aggregate liability of either party, together with any of its Affiliates, arising out of or related to any Purchased Offering exceed the total amount paid by you for that Purchased Offering in the twelve (12) months preceding the first incident out of which the liability arose. However, the foregoing limitation will not limit your obligations under the &quot;Payment&quot; section above and will not be deemed to limit your rights to any service level credits under any applicable Service Level Schedule.

#### **2. Purchasing Through Authorized Resellers, Digital Marketplaces, and Splunk Affiliates**

A. **Authorized Resellers and Digital Marketplaces.** If you purchase Offerings through a Splunk authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, these General Terms will govern those Offerings. Your payment obligations for the Purchased Offerings will be with the authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, as applicable, not Splunk. You will have no direct Fee payment obligations to Splunk for those Offerings. However, in the event that you fail to pay the Digital Marketplace for your Purchased Offerings, Splunk retains the right to enforce your payment obligations and collect directly from you.

Any terms agreed to between you and the authorized reseller that are in addition to these General Terms are solely between you and the authorized reseller and Digital Marketplace, as applicable. No agreement between you and an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace is binding on Splunk or will have any force or effect with respect to the rights in, or the operation, use or provision of, the Offerings.

B. **Splunk Affiliate Distributors.** Splunk has appointed certain Splunk Affiliates as its non-exclusive distributors of the Offerings (each, a &quot;**Splunk Affiliate Distributor**&quot;). Each Splunk Affiliate Distributor is authorized by Splunk to negotiate and enter into Orders with Customers. Where a purchase from Splunk is offered by a Splunk Affiliate Distributor, Customer will issue Orders, and make payments, to the Splunk Affiliate Distributor which issued the quote for the Offering. Each Order will be deemed a separate contract between Customer and the relevant Splunk Affiliate Distributor and will be subject to these General Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer agrees that: (i) the total liability of Splunk under these General Terms as set forth in Section 22 (Limitation of Liability) states the overall combined liability of Splunk and Splunk Affiliate Distributors; (ii) the entering into Orders by a Splunk Affiliate Distributor will not be deemed to expand Splunk and its Affiliates’ overall responsibilities or liability under these General Terms; and (iii) Customer will have no right to recover more than once from the same event.

#### **3. Your Contractors and Third-Party Providers**

You may permit your authorized consultants, contractors, and agents (&quot;**Third-Party Providers**&quot;) to access and use your Purchased Offerings, but only on your behalf in connection with providing services to you, and subject to the terms and conditions of these General Terms.

A. **Certification and Verification.** At Splunk’s request, you will furnish Splunk a certification signed by your authorized representative verifying that your use of the Purchased Offering is in accordance with these General Terms and the applicable Order. For On-Premises Products, we may also ask you from time to time, but not more frequently than once per calendar period, to cooperate with us to verify usage and adherence to purchased Capacities. If Splunk requests a verification process, you agree to provide Splunk reasonable access to the On-Premises Product installed at your facility (or as hosted by your Third-Party Provider). If Splunk does any verification, it will be performed with as little interference as possible to your use of the On-Premises Product and your business operations. Splunk will comply with your (or your Third-Party Providers’) reasonable security procedures.

B. **Overages.** If a verification or usage report reveals that you have exceeded the purchased Capacity or usage rights for your Purchased Offering (e.g., used as a service bureau) during the period reviewed, then we will have the right to invoice you using the applicable Fees at list price then in effect, which will be payable in accordance with these General Terms. Without limiting Splunk’s foregoing rights, with respect to Hosted Services, Splunk may work with you to reduce usage so that it conforms to the applicable usage limit, and we will in good faith discuss options to right size your subscription as appropriate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Splunk will have the right to directly invoice you for overages, regardless of whether you purchased the Purchased Offering from an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace. See the Specific Offering Terms for any additional information related to overages for a Hosted Service.

#### **13. Our Use of Open Source**

Certain Offerings may contain Open Source Software. Splunk makes available in the applicable Documentation a list of Open Source Software incorporated in our On-Premises Products as required by the respective Open Source Software licenses. Any Open Source Software that is delivered as part of your Offering and which may not be removed or used separately from the Offering is covered by the warranty, support and indemnification provisions applicable to the Offering. Some of the Open Source Software may have additional terms that apply to the use of the Offering (e.g., the obligation for us to provide attribution of the specific licensor), and those terms will be included in the Documentation; however, these terms will not (a) impose any additional restrictions on your use of the Offering, or (b) negate or amend any of our responsibilities with respect to the Offering.

#### **14. Splunk Developer Tools and Customer Extensions**

Splunk makes Splunk Developer Tools available to you so you can develop Extensions for use with your Purchased Offerings (Extensions that you develop, &quot;**Customer Extensions**&quot;).

You have a nonexclusive, worldwide, nontransferable, nonsublicensable right, subject to the terms of these General Terms, to use Splunk Developer Tools to develop your Customer Extensions, including to support interoperability between the Offering and your system or environment. Splunk proprietary legends or notices contained in the Splunk Developer Tools may not be removed or altered when used in or with your Customer Extension.

You agree to assume full responsibility for the performance and distribution of Customer Extensions.

#### **15. Third Party Products, Third-Party Extensions, Third-Party Content and Unsupported Splunk Extensions**

A. **Third-Party Extensions on Splunkbase.** Splunk makes Extensions developed and/or made available by a third-party on Splunkbase (&quot;**Third-Party Extension**&quot;) available for download or access as a convenience to its customers. Splunk makes no promises or guarantees related to any Third-Party Extension, including the accuracy, integrity, quality, or security of the Third-Party Extension. Nothing in these General Terms or on Splunkbase will be deemed to be a representation or warranty by Splunk with respect to any Third-Party Extension, even if a particular Third-Party Extension is identified as &quot;certified&quot; or &quot;validated&quot; for use with an Offering. We may, in our reasonable discretion, block or disable access to any Third-Party Extension at any time. Your use of a Third-Party Extension is at your own risk and may be subject to any additional terms, conditions, and policies applicable to that Third-Party Extension (such as license terms, terms of service, or privacy policies of the providers of such Third-Party Extension). Third-Party Extensions may be installed on Hosted Services pursuant to our instructions.

B. **Third Party Content.** Hosted Services may contain features or functions that enable interoperation with Third-Party Content that you, in your sole discretion, choose to add to a Hosted Service. You may be required to obtain access separately to such Third-Party Content from the respective providers, and you may be required to grant Splunk access to your accounts with such providers to the extent necessary for Splunk to allow the interoperation with the Hosted Service. By requesting or allowing Splunk to enable access to such Third-Party Content in connection with the Hosted Services, you certify that you are authorized under the provider’s terms to allow such access. If you install or enable (or direct or otherwise authorize Splunk to install or enable) Third-Party Content for use with a Hosted Service where the interoperation includes access by the third-party provider to your Customer Content, you hereby authorize Splunk to allow the provider of such Third-Party Content to access Customer Content as necessary for the interoperation. You agree that Splunk is not responsible or liable for disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Content resulting from access to Customer Content by such Third-Party Content, nor is Splunk liable for any damages or downtime that you may incur or any impact on your experience of the Hosted Service, directly or indirectly, as a result of your use of and/or reliance upon, any Third-Party Content, sites or resources.

C. **Splunk As a Reseller.** When you purchase third party products (&quot;**Third Party Products**&quot;) from Splunk as specified in an Order (which products shall include third party software, but not any support which Splunk itself has contracted to provide), the following provision applies. Splunk acts solely as a reseller of Third Party Products, which are fulfilled by the relevant third party vendor (&quot;**Third Party Vendor**&quot;), and the purchase and use of Third Party Products is subject solely to the terms, conditions and policies made available by such Third Party Vendor. Consequently, Splunk makes no representation or warranty of any kind regarding the Third Party Products, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, and specifically disclaims all implied terms, conditions and warranties (including as to quality, performance, availability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. You will bring any claim in relation to Third Party Products against the applicable Third Party Vendor directly. In no event will Splunk be liable to you for any claim, loss or damage arising out of the use, operation or availability of Third Party Product (whether such liability arises in contract, negligence, tort, or otherwise).

D. **Unsupported Splunk Extensions.** The Service Level Schedule commitments for any applicable Hosted Services will not apply to Splunk Extensions labeled on Splunkbase as &quot;**Not Supported.**&quot; You agree that Splunk is not responsible for any impact on your experience of a Hosted Service, as a result of your installation and/or use of any &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extensions, and that your sole remedy will be to remove the &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extension from the applicable Hosted Service. Further, some Splunk Extensions may not be compatible or certified for use with that Hosted Service (e.g., only specific Splunk Extensions are validated for our FedRAMP authorized environment for Splunk Cloud Platform). Please refer to the applicable Documentation for more information related to the Splunk Extensions compatible with your specific Purchased Offering.

#### **16. Your Compliance**

A. **Lawful Use of Offerings.** When you access and use an Offering, you are responsible for complying with all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to your access and use. This includes being responsible for your Customer Content and users, for your users’ compliance with these General Terms, and the accuracy, lawful use of, and the means by which you acquired your Customer Content. You may not transmit and/or store PHI Data, PCI Data or ITAR Data within a Hosted Services unless you have specifically purchased a Purchased Offering for that applicable regulated Hosted Services environment (as identified in an Order).

You are responsible for securing, protecting, and maintaining the confidentiality of your account usernames, passwords and access tokens.

C. **Export Compliance.** You will comply with all applicable export laws and regulations of the United States and any other country (&quot;Export Laws&quot;) where your users use any of the Offerings.

#### **21. Term and Termination**

A. **Term and Renewal.** These General Terms will commence upon the Effective Date and will remain in effect until the expiration of all applicable Purchased Offerings, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Section. Termination of a specific Purchased Offering will not affect the Term of any other Purchased Offering. Termination of these General Terms will have the effect of terminating all Purchased Offerings. Grounds for terminating a Purchased Offering (e.g., for non-payment), that are specific to the Purchased Offering, will not be grounds to terminate Purchased Offerings where no breach exists. Unless indicated otherwise in an Order, the Term of a Purchased Offering (and these General Terms) will automatically renew for an additional period of time equal to the length of the preceding Term, unless one party notifies the other of its intent not to renew at least one (1) day in advance of the expiration of the Term or then-current renewal period.

B. **Termination.** Either party may terminate these General Terms, or any Purchased Offering, by written notice to the other party in the event of a material breach of these General Terms, or the specific terms associated with that Purchased Offering, that is not cured within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice.

**In no event will the aggregate liability of either party, together with any of its Affiliates, arising out of or related to any Purchased Offering exceed the total amount paid by you for that Purchased Offering in the twelve (12) months preceding the first incident out of which the liability arose. However, the foregoing limitation will not limit your obligations under the &quot;Payment&quot; section above and will not be deemed to limit your rights to any service level credits under any applicable Service Level Schedule. Furthermore, the cap above will not be deemed to limit Splunk’s right to recover amounts for your use of an Offering in excess of the Capacity purchased or use outside of Internal Business Purposes.**

**In no event will either party or its Affiliates have any liability arising out of or related to these General Terms for any lost profits, revenues, goodwill, or indirect, special, incidental, consequential, cover, business interruption or punitive damages.**

**The limitation of liability herein will not apply to a party’s infringement of the other party’s intellectual property rights, indemnification obligations, or the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of a party.**

**The foregoing disclaimers of damages will also not apply to the extent prohibited by law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. To the extent such a law applies to you, some or all of the exclusions or limitations set forth above may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights.**

#### **23. Indemnity**

    We will have no obligation to provide support for issues caused by any of the following (each, a &quot;**Customer Generated Error**&quot;): (i) modifications to an Offering not made by Splunk; (ii) use of an Offering other than as authorized in the General Terms or as provided in the applicable Documentation; (iii) damage to the machine on which an On-Premises Product is installed; (iv) use of a version of an Offering other than the Supported Version; (v) third-party products that are not expressly noted in the Documentation as supported by Splunk; or (vi) conflicts related to replacing or installing hardware, drivers, and software that are not expressly supported by Splunk and described in the applicable Documentation. If we determine that support requested by you is for an issue caused by a Customer Generated Error, we will notify you of that fact as soon as reasonably possible under the circumstances. If you agree that we should provide support for the Customer Generated Error via a confirming email, then we will have the right to invoice you at our then-current time and materials rates for any such support provided by us.

6. **Support for Splunk Extensions**

    Only Splunk Extensions that are labeled as &quot;**Splunk Supported**&quot; on Splunkbase, or other Splunk-branded marketplace, are eligible for support, and this support is limited. For those labeled Splunk Supported, we will provide an initial response and acknowledgement in accordance with the P3 terms that are applicable in the applicable Support Program, and Enhancements may be made available. No other terms of a Support Program will apply to a Splunk Application. For those labeled as &quot;**Not Supported**,&quot; Splunk will have no support obligations.

7. **Authorized Support Contacts**

    You are entitled to have a certain number of Support Contacts under each Support Program. &quot;**Support Contacts**&quot; means the individual(s) specified by you that are authorized to submit support cases.

    The number of Support Contacts will be based on the Capacity of the Offering purchased, and the applicable Support Program. The number of Support Contacts will be set forth in customer’s entitlement information on the Splunk support portal.

    We only take support requests from, and communicate with, your Support Contacts in connection with support cases. We strongly recommend that your Support Contact(s) are trained on the applicable Offering. In order to designate Support Contacts, you must provide the individual’s primary email address and Splunk.com login ID.

8. **Defect Resolution**

    Should we determine that an Offering has a defect, we will, at our sole option, repair the defect in the version of the Offering that you are then currently using or instruct you to install a newer version of the Offering with that defect repaired. We reserve the right to provide you with a workaround in lieu of fixing a defect should we in our sole judgment determine that it is more effective to do so.

9. **Your Assistance**

    Should you report a purported defect or error in an Offering, we may require you to provide us with the following information: (a) a general description of your operating environment; (b) a list of all hardware components, operating systems and networks; (c) a reproducible test case; and (d) any log files, trace and systems files. Your failure to provide this information may prevent us from identifying and fixing that purported defect.

10. **Changes to Support Programs**

    You acknowledge that, subject to the Support Policy, and subject to any commitment we have during the Term, we have the right to discontinue the manufacture, development, sale or support of any Offering, at any time, in our sole discretion. We further reserve the right to alter Support Programs from time to time, using reasonable discretion, but in no event will such alterations, during the Term of any Order, result in diminished Support Services from the level of your applicable purchased Support Program.

### **Configuration and Implementation Services Exhibit to Splunk General Terms**

This Configuration and Implementation Services Exhibit forms a part of the Splunk General Terms and governs your purchase, and Splunk’s provision of Configuration and Implementation Services.

**Capitalized terms below are defined in the General Terms, this Exhibit or in the Definition Exhibit attached to this Exhibit.**

1. **Services and Statements of Work**

    We will perform the C&I Services for you that are set forth in the applicable Statements of Work. You will pay the Fees under each Statement of Work in accordance with these General Terms, or otherwise as we may expressly agree in the applicable Statement of Work.

    In each Statement of Work, we will designate our primary point of contact for you for all matters relating to the applicable C&I Services (which we may change from time to time upon notice).

2. **Our Personnel**

    A. **Qualifications.** The Personnel we assign to perform the C&I Services will be qualified, skilled, experienced and otherwise fit for the performance of the C&I Services. If you, in your reasonable judgement, determine that Personnel assigned to your project are unfit, we will in good faith discuss alternatives, and we will replace Personnel as reasonably necessary. You acknowledge that any replacement may cause delay in the performance of the C&I Services.

    B. **Personnel Conduct.** Our Personnel are subject to our Splunk Code of Conduct and Ethics [here](https://investors.splunk.com/static-files/3c2a9a40-7f6e-4795-9358-b5565826b13d?_ga=2.200727335.82146825.1675981089-269939538.1673288458&_gac=1.188710106.1674005341.Cj0KCQiAq5meBhCyARIsAJrtdr75-RptXmmxNnKzoOJ_p26uX0MwT-GzxcrmWSotrQqWFlaOLtYVyhgaAuriEALw_wcB&_gl=1*1m2mlyb*_ga*MjY5OTM5NTM4LjE2NzMyODg0NTg.*_ga_5EPM2P39FV*MTY3NjA1MTkwNi40OC4xLjE2NzYwNjAxMzMuMzYuMC4w), which includes, without limitation, an obligation to comply with our policies on protecting customer information, prohibitions on illegal drugs and any impaired job performance, avoiding conflicts of interest, and acting ethically at all times. We also background check our employees, per the Section below.

    C. **Use of Subcontractors.** We reserve the right to use subcontractors in performance of the C&I Services, provided: (a) any subcontractor we use meets the requirements herein and conditions of these General Terms and the Statement of Work; (b) we will be responsible for the subcontractor’s compliance with the terms herein and the Statement of Work; and (c) upon your request or inquiry, we will identify any subcontractor that we are using, or plan to use, for C&I Services, and will cooperate in good faith to provide you with all relevant information regarding such subcontractors.

    D. **No Employee Benefits.** We acknowledge and agree that our Personnel are not eligible for or entitled to receive any compensation, benefits, or other incidents of employment that you make available to your employees. We are solely responsible for all employment related taxes, expenses, withholdings, and other similar statutory obligations arising out of the relationship between us and our Personnel and the performance of C&I Services by such Personnel.

3. **Our Background Checks, Security and Compliance Obligations**

    A. **Compliance with Your Security Program.** While on your premises, our Personnel will comply with your security practices and procedures generally prescribed by you for onsite visitors and service providers. However, any requirement that is in addition to the compliance requirements set forth in this Schedule (e.g., background checks that are different from the background checks described herein) must be expressly set forth in a Statement of Work. We agree to discuss in good faith any condition or requirement you may have for our Personnel that are different from standard policies, however any additional requirement may delay C&I Services and must be vetted and implemented by mutual agreement of the parties and expressly set forth in a Statement of Work. Splunk does not guarantee that it will be able to meet any additional requested requirements.

    B. **Our Security Practices.** We implement and follow an enterprise security program, with the policies, plans, and procedures set forth here [www.splunk.com/prof-serv-isa](www.splunk.com/prof-serv-isa). Our Personnel will be subject to the data protection and confidentiality obligations set forth in these General Terms with respect to any of your data that we may have access to in connection with the C&I Services.

    C. **Background Checks.** For U.S.-based projects, we will not assign an employee to perform C&I Services under a Statement of Work unless we have run the following background check on the employee: Criminal Felony & Misdemeanor; SSN Validation; Federal Criminal; SSN Trace; Employment Report – Three (3) Employers; Education Report – One (1) Institution; Global Sanctions & Enforcement; Prohibited Parties; Widescreen Plus National Criminal Search.

    D. **Permissions for Access.** In the event you require any Personnel to sign any waivers, releases, or other documents as a condition to gain access to your premises for performance of the C&I Services (&quot;**Access Documents**&quot;), you agree: (a) that Personnel who will be required to sign Access Documents will sign on behalf of Splunk; (b) that any additional or conflicting terms in Access Documents with these General Terms will have no effect; and (c) you will pursue any claims for breach of any terms in the Access Documents against Splunk and not the individual signing.

4. **Your Materials**

    We will have no rights in or to any Customer Materials, however you grant us the right to use Customer Materials in order to provide the C&I Services. Nothing in these General Terms will deemed to transfer to us any ownership of Customer Materials.

5. **C&I Services Materials and Customizations Unique to You**

    A. **C&I Services Materials.** The C&I Services we perform (e.g., configuration of our Offerings), and the C&I Services Materials we offer, create, and deliver to you in connection with the C&I Services, are generally applicable to our business, and therefore we require the right to be able to re-use the C&I Services Materials we create for one customer in connection with all of our customers. For the avoidance of doubt, our use of the C&I Services Materials created for you in connection with C&I Services will comply with our ongoing obligations and restrictions with respect to your Customer Materials and your Confidential Information, and we will not identify you in any way in connection with our further use of such C&I Services Materials.

    B. **Customer Owned Work Product.** However, in the unlikely event that the parties agree that C&I Services Materials for a project are custom work product unique to your business, and not applicable to other customers generally, we will transfer ownership to those agreed C&I Services Materials to you under the applicable Statement of Work. C&I Services Materials must be expressly identified as &quot;**Customer Owned Work Product**&quot; under a Statement of Work for ownership to pass to you. Subject to payment of applicable Fees under the Statement of Work, we hereby assign to you all rights, title and interest (including all Intellectual Property Rights therein) in and to all C&I Services Materials identified as Customer Owned Work Product (but excluding all Splunk Preexisting IP incorporated into the Customer Owned Work Product). At your request and expense, we will assist and cooperate with you in all reasonable respects and will execute documents and take such further acts reasonably requested by you to enable you to acquire, transfer, maintain, perfect, and enforce your ownership rights in such Customer Owned Work Product.

    C. **Our Ownership.** Subject to your ownership rights in Customer Owned Work Product and Customer Materials, we will own all rights in and to all C&I Services Materials.

    D. **License Rights.** For those C&I Services Materials that are not Customer Owned Work Product, you will have the right to access and use those C&I Services Materials in connection with your applicable Offerings, and those rights will be of the same scope and duration as your rights to the underlying Offering.

6. **C&I Services Warranty**

    We warrant that the C&I Services will be performed in a good and workmanlike manner consistent with applicable industry standards. This warranty will be in effect for a period of thirty (30) days from the completion of any C&I Services. As your sole and exclusive remedy and our entire liability for any breach of the foregoing warranty, we will, at our option and expense, promptly re-perform any C&I Services that fail to meet this warranty or refund to you the fees paid for the non-conforming C&I Services.

7. **Your Cooperation**

    You acknowledge that your timely provision of (and our access to) your facilities, equipment, assistance, cooperation, data, information and materials from your officers, agents, and employees (the &quot;**Cooperation**&quot;) is essential to Splunk’s performance of the C&I Services. We will not be liable for any delay or deficiency in performing the C&I Services if you do not provide the necessary Cooperation. As part of the Cooperation, you will (1) designate a project manager or technical lead to liaise with us while we perform the C&I Services; (2) allocate and engage additional resources as may be required to assist us in performing the C&I Services; and (3) making available to us any data, information and any other materials reasonably required by us to perform the C&I Services, including any data, information or materials specifically identified in the Statement of Work.

8. **Insurance**

    Throughout any period of C&I Services we perform for you, we will maintain insurance policies in the types and amounts described below at our own expense:

    - Commercial General Liability Insurance with a limit of not less than $1,000,000 per occurrence and a general aggregate limit of not less than $2,000,000.

    - Business Auto Insurance with a limit of not less than $1,000,000 combined single limit. Such Insurance will cover liability arising out of &quot;hired and non-owned&quot; automobiles.

    - Technology Errors & Omissions Insurance with a limit of not less than $3,000,000 per occurrence and general aggregate.

    - Umbrella/Excess Insurance with a limit of not less than $3,000,000 per occurrence and general aggregate.

9. **Change Order Process**

    You may submit written requests to us to change the scope of C&I Services described in a Statement of Work (each such request, a &quot;**Change Order Request**&quot;). If we elect to consider a Change Order Request, then we will promptly notify you if we believe that the Change Order Request requires an adjustment to the fees or to the schedule for the performance of the C&I Services. In such event, the parties will negotiate in good faith a reasonable and equitable adjustment to the fees and/or schedule, as applicable. We will continue to perform C&I Services pursuant to the existing Statement of Work and will have no obligation to perform any Change Order Request unless and until the parties have agreed in writing to such an equitable adjustment.

10. **Expenses**

    Unless otherwise specified in the Statement of Work, we will not charge you for our expenses we incur in connection with a Statement of Work. Our daily C&I Services rates are inclusive of any expenses. In the event the parties agree that expenses are reimbursable under a Statement of Work, we will mutually agree on any travel policy and any required documentation for reimbursement.

11. **Prepaid C&I Services**

    Unless otherwise expressly stated in a Statement of Work, all prepaid C&I Services must be redeemed within twelve (12) months from the date of purchase/invoice. At the end of the twelve (12) month term, any remaining pre-paid unused C&I Services will expire; no refunds will be provided for any remaining pre-paid unused C&I Services. Unless otherwise specifically stated in a Statement of Work, Education is invoiced and payable in advance.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

# **SPLUNK GENERAL TERMS**

Last Updated: February 10, 2023

These Splunk General Terms (&quot;General Terms&quot;) between Splunk Inc., a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business at 270 Brannan Street, San Francisco, California 94107, U.S.A (&quot;Splunk&quot; or &quot;we&quot; or &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) and you (&quot;Customer&quot; or &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) apply to the purchase of licenses and subscriptions for Splunk’s Offerings. By clicking on the appropriate button, or by downloading, installing, accessing or using the Offerings, you agree to these General Terms. If you are entering into these General Terms on behalf of Customer, you represent that you have the authority to bind Customer. If you do not agree to these General Terms, or if you are not authorized to accept the General Terms on behalf of the Customer, do not download, install, access, or use any of the Offerings.

**See the General Terms Definitions Exhibit attached for definitions of capitalized terms not defined herein.**

#### **1. License Rights**

A. **General Rights.** You have the nonexclusive, worldwide, nontransferable and nonsublicensable right, subject to payment of applicable Fees and compliance with the terms of these General Terms, to use your Purchased Offerings for your Internal Business Purposes during the Term and up to the Capacity purchased.

B. **Copies for On-Premise Products.** You have the right to make a reasonable number of copies of On-Premises Products for archival and back-up purposes.

C. **Splunk Extensions.** You may use Splunk Extensions solely in connection with the applicable Purchased Offering subject to the same terms and conditions for that Offering (including with respect to Term) and payment of any Fees associated with the Splunk Extensions. Some Splunk Extensions may be made available under license terms that provide broader rights than the license rights you have to the applicable underlying Offering (e.g., if the Extension is Open Source Software). These broader rights will apply to that Splunk Extension. Splunk Extensions may be installed on Hosted Services pursuant to our instructions.

D. **Trials, Evaluations, Beta and Free Licenses.**

<ol type="i">
  <li><b>Trials and Evaluations.</b> Offerings provided for trials and evaluations are provided at no charge, and their use will be for a limited duration.</li>
  <li><b>Beta Licenses.</b> Some Offerings and features may be available to you as a preview, or as an alpha, beta or other pre-release version (each, a "<b>Beta Offering</b>"). All rights for Beta Offerings are solely for internal testing and evaluation. Your use of a Beta Offering will be for the term specified by us, and if no term is specified, then for the earlier of one year from the start date of the Beta Offering or when that version of the Beta Offering becomes generally available. We may discontinue the Beta Offering at any time and may decide not to make any of the features and functionality generally available.</li>
  <li><b>Free Licenses.</b> From time to time, we may make certain Offerings available for full use (i.e., not subject to limited evaluation purposes) at no charge. These free Offerings may have limited features, functions, and other technical limitations.</li>
  <li><b>Donated Offerings.</b> Donated Offerings are free limited Offerings donated to qualifying Nonprofits under a Splunk donation program. By procuring and making use of a Donated Offering, you hereby represent and warrant that you are a lawfully organized Nonprofit, and you agree to provide verification of your nonprofit status to Splunk upon request. At Splunk’s request, you agree: (a) to publish a press release and case study on your use of the Donated Offering; and (b) to be interviewed for the production of a Splunk customer video that will accompany the press release and case study. Splunk will draft and edit all content in collaboration with you and will obtain your edits and written approval (email is sufficient) prior to publication, and such approval will not be unreasonably withheld. You will allow Splunk to reference your Nonprofit and leading spokespeople in press releases with your written approval (email is sufficient). Splunk may use your name and logo on sales presentations, websites, and other marketing collateral without your prior approval.</li>
 <li><b>Test and Development Licenses.</b> For Offerings identified as "<b>Test and Development</b>" Offerings on your Order, you only have the right to use those Offerings up to the applicable Capacity on a non-production system for non-production uses, including product migration testing or pre-production staging, or testing new data sources, types, or use cases. Test and Development Offerings may not be used for any revenue generation, commercial activity, or other productive business or purpose.</li>
<li><b>Limitations.</b> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these General Terms, we do not provide maintenance and support, warranties, service level commitments, or indemnification for Test and Development Offerings, trials, evaluations, or free or Beta Offerings.</li>
</ol>

#### **2. Purchasing Through Authorized Resellers, Digital Marketplaces, and Splunk Affiliates**

A. **Authorized Resellers and Digital Marketplaces.** If you purchase Offerings through a Splunk authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, these General Terms will govern those Offerings. Your payment obligations for the Purchased Offerings will be with the authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, as applicable, not Splunk. You will have no direct Fee payment obligations to Splunk for those Offerings. However, in the event that you fail to pay the Digital Marketplace for your Purchased Offerings, Splunk retains the right to enforce your payment obligations and collect directly from you.

Any terms agreed to between you and the authorized reseller that are in addition to these General Terms are solely between you and the authorized reseller and Digital Marketplace, as applicable. No agreement between you and an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace is binding on Splunk or will have any force or effect with respect to the rights in, or the operation, use or provision of, the Offerings.

B. **Splunk Affiliate Distributors.** Splunk has appointed certain Splunk Affiliates as its non-exclusive distributors of the Offerings (each, a &quot;**Splunk Affiliate Distributor**&quot;). Each Splunk Affiliate Distributor is authorized by Splunk to negotiate and enter into Orders with Customers. Where a purchase from Splunk is offered by a Splunk Affiliate Distributor, Customer will issue Orders, and make payments, to the Splunk Affiliate Distributor which issued the quote for the Offering. Each Order will be deemed a separate contract between Customer and the relevant Splunk Affiliate Distributor and will be subject to these General Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer agrees that: (i) the total liability of Splunk under these General Terms as set forth in Section 22 (Limitation of Liability) states the overall combined liability of Splunk and Splunk Affiliate Distributors; (ii) the entering into Orders by a Splunk Affiliate Distributor will not be deemed to expand Splunk and its Affiliates’ overall responsibilities or liability under these General Terms; and (iii) Customer will have no right to recover more than once from the same event.

#### **3. Your Contractors and Third-Party Providers**

You may permit your authorized consultants, contractors, and agents (&quot;**Third-Party Providers**&quot;) to access and use your Purchased Offerings, but only on your behalf in connection with providing services to you, and subject to the terms and conditions of these General Terms. Any access or use by a Third-Party Provider will be subject to the same limitations and restrictions that apply to you under these General Terms, and you will be responsible for any Third-Party Provider’s actions relating to their use of the Offering. The aggregate use by you and all of your Third-Party Providers must not exceed the Capacity purchased, and nothing in this Section is intended to or will be deemed to increase such Capacity.

#### **4. Hosted Services and Specific Offering Terms**

A. **Service Levels.** When you purchase Hosted Services as a Purchased Offering, we will make the applicable Hosted Services available to you during the Term in accordance with these General Terms. The Service Level Schedules (as identified in the Specific Offering Terms referenced in Section 4(F) below) and associated remedies will apply to the availability and uptime of the applicable Hosted Service. If applicable, service credits will be available for downtime in accordance with the Service Level Schedule.

B. **Connections.** You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all telecommunications, broadband and computer equipment and services needed to access and use Hosted Services, and for paying all associated charges.

C. **Your Responsibility for Data Protection.** You are responsible for: (i) selecting from the security configurations and security options made available by Splunk in connection with a Hosted Service; (ii) taking additional measures outside of the Hosted Service to the extent the Hosted Service Offering does not provide the controls that may be required or desired by you; and (iii) routine archiving and backing up of Customer Content. You agree to notify Splunk promptly if you believe that an unauthorized third party may be using your accounts or if your account information is lost or stolen.

D. **Refund Upon Termination for Splunk’s Breach.** If a Hosted Service is terminated by you for Splunk’s uncured material breach in accordance with these General Terms, Splunk will refund you any prepaid subscription fees covering the remainder of the Term after the effective date of termination.

E. **Return of Customer Content.** Customer Content may be retrieved by you and removed from the Hosted Services in accordance with the applicable Documentation. We will make the Customer Content available on the Hosted Services for thirty (30) days after termination of a subscription for your retrieval. After that thirty (30) day period, we will have no obligation to maintain the storage of your Customer Content, and you hereby authorize us thereafter to, and we will, unless legally prohibited, delete all remaining Customer Content. If you require assistance in connection with migration of your Customer Content, depending on the nature of the request, we may require a mutually agreed upon fee for assistance.

F. **Specific Offering Terms.** Specific security controls and certifications, data policies, service descriptions, Service Level Schedules and other terms specific to a Hosted Service and other Offerings (&quot;**Specific Offering Terms**&quot;) are set forth here: [www.splunk.com/SpecificTerms](www.splunk.com/SpecificTerms), and will apply, and be deemed incorporated herein by reference.

#### **5. Support and Maintenance**

The specific Support Program included with a Purchased Offering will be identified in the applicable Order. Splunk will provide the purchased level of support and maintenance services in accordance with the terms of the Support Exhibit attached to these General Terms.

#### **6. Configuration and Implementation Services**

Splunk offers standard services to implement and configure your Purchased Offerings. These services are purchased under an Order and are subject to the payment of the Fees therein and the terms of the Configuration and Implementation Services Exhibit attached to these General Terms.

#### **7. Data Protection for Personal Data**

Splunk will follow globally recognized data protection principles and industry-leading standards for the security of personal data. Splunk will comply with the requirements and obligations set forth in Splunk’s Data Processing Addendum (&quot;**DPA**&quot;), located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-dpa.html, which includes standard terms for the processing of personal data (including, as applicable, personal data in a Hosted Service).

#### **8. Security**

A. **Security for Hosted Services: Standard Environment.** Splunk will implement industry leading security safeguards for the protection of Customer Confidential Information, including Customer Content transferred to and stored within the Hosted Services. These safeguards include commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect Customer Content against destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or unauthorized access, including such things as information security policies and procedures, security awareness training, threat and vulnerability management, incident response and breach notification, and vendor risk management. Splunk’s technical safeguards are further described in the Splunk Cloud Platform Security Addendum (&quot;**SC-SA**&quot;), located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-cloud-security-addendum.html, and the Observability Suite Security Addendum (&quot;**OS-SA**&quot;), located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-observability-security-addendum.html, as applicable, and are incorporated herein by reference. Splunk may update the SC-SA and OS-SA from time to time provided, that updates will be subject to Section 24 below.

B. **Security for Hosted Services: Premium HIPAA Environment.** For Hosted Services Offerings provisioned in Splunk Cloud Platform’s Premium HIPAA environment (as specified in an Order), in addition to the protections under the SC-SA and these General Terms, Splunk will comply with the requirements and obligations set forth in Splunk Business Associate Agreement found here: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-baa.html.

C. **Additional Security for Other Hosted Services.** From time to time, Splunk may offer custom security safeguards for unique Hosted Services offerings. Any such security safeguards will be as set forth in the applicable Documentation and Specific Offering Terms.

D. **Security for On Premises Offerings.** Splunk will implement industry leading security safeguards for the protection of Splunk’s IT systems, products, facilities and assets, and any Customer Confidential Information accessed or processed therein, e.g., customer account information, support tickets (&quot;**Corporate Security Controls**&quot;). Splunk’s Corporate Security Controls include such things as information security policies and procedures, security awareness training, physical and environmental access controls, threat and vulnerability management, incident response and breach notification, and vendor risk management. Splunk’s Corporate Security Controls are further described in Splunk’s Information Security Addendum (&quot;**ISA**&quot;), located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/information-security-addendum.html and are incorporated herein by reference.

E. **Product Development Security.** Splunk will follow secure software development practices and applies an industry standard, risk-based approach to its software development lifecycle (&quot;**SDLC**&quot;), which includes, as applicable, such things as performing security architecture reviews, open source security scans, virus detection, dynamic application security testing, network vulnerability scans and external penetration testing in the development environment. Product-specific information about the SDLC in our Offerings is detailed more fully in the ISA. Splunk’s Product Security Portal, located at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/product-security.html, contains detailed information about Splunk’s program for managing and communicating product vulnerabilities. Splunk categorizes product vulnerabilities in accordance with the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (&quot;Medium,&quot; &quot;High,&quot; or &quot;Critical&quot;) and uses commercially reasonable efforts to remediate vulnerabilities depending on their severity level in accordance with industry standards.

F. **Maintaining Protections.** Notwithstanding anything to contrary in these General Terms, or any policy or terms referenced herein via hyperlink (or any update thereto), Splunk may not, during a Term materially diminish the security protections set forth in these General Terms, any Specific Offering Terms, or the applicable security addendum.

#### **9. Use Restrictions**

Except as expressly permitted in an Order, these General Terms or our Documentation, you agree not to (nor allow any user or Third Party Provider to): (a) reverse engineer (except to the extent specifically permitted by statutory law), decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover source code or underlying structures, ideas or algorithms of any Offering; (b) modify, translate or create derivative works based on the Offerings; (c) use an Offering to ingest, monitor or analyze the machine, IT system or application data of any third party; (d) resell, transfer or distribute any Offering; (e) access or use any Offering in order to monitor its availability, performance, or functionality for competitive purposes; (f) attempt to disable or circumvent any license key or other technological mechanisms or measures intended to prevent, limit or control use or copying of, or access to, Offerings; (g) separately use any of the applicable features and functionalities of the Offerings with external applications or code not furnished by Splunk or any data not processed by the Offering; (h) exceed the Capacity purchased or (i) use any Offering in violation of all applicable laws and regulations (including but not limited to any applicable privacy and intellectual property laws).

#### **10. Our Ethics, Compliance and Corporate Responsibility**

A. **Ethics and Corporate Responsibility.** Splunk is committed to acting ethically and in compliance with applicable law, and we have policies and guidelines in place to provide awareness of, and compliance with, the laws and regulations that apply to our business globally. We are committed to ethical business conduct, and we use diligent efforts to perform in accordance with the highest global ethical principles, as described in the Splunk Code of Conduct and Ethics found [here](https://investors.splunk.com/static-files/3c2a9a40-7f6e-4795-9358-b5565826b13d?_ga=2.27382325.82146825.1675981089-269939538.1673288458&_gac=1.127441023.1674005341.Cj0KCQiAq5meBhCyARIsAJrtdr75-RptXmmxNnKzoOJ_p26uX0MwT-GzxcrmWSotrQqWFlaOLtYVyhgaAuriEALw_wcB&_gl=1*1xgvjcs*_ga*MjY5OTM5NTM4LjE2NzMyODg0NTg.*_ga_5EPM2P39FV*MTY3NjA1MTkwNi40OC4xLjE2NzYwNjAxMzMuMzYuMC4w).

B. **Anti-Corruption.** We implement and maintain programs for compliance with applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. Splunk policy prohibits the offering or soliciting of any illegal or improper bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value to or from any of your employees or agents in connection with these General Terms. If we learn of any violation of the above, we will use reasonable efforts to promptly notify you at the main contact address provided by you to Splunk.

C. **Export.** We certify that Splunk is not on any of the relevant U.S. or EU government lists of prohibited persons, including the Treasury Department’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and the Commerce Department’s List of Denied Persons or Entity List. Export information regarding our Offerings, including our export control classifications for our Offerings, is found here: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/export-controls.html.

#### **11. Usage Data**

From time to time, Splunk may collect Usage Data generated as a by-product of your use of Offerings. Usage Data does not include Customer Content. We collect Usage Data for a variety of reasons, such as to identify, understand, and anticipate performance issues and the factors that affect them, to provide updates and personalized experiences to customers, and to improve the Splunk Offerings. Details on Splunk’s Usage Data collection practices are set forth in Splunk's Privacy Policy found here: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/privacy/privacy-policy.html.

#### **12. Capacity and Usage Verification**

A. **Certification and Verification.** At Splunk’s request, you will furnish Splunk a certification signed by your authorized representative verifying that your use of the Purchased Offering is in accordance with these General Terms and the applicable Order. For On-Premises Products, we may also ask you from time to time, but not more frequently than once per calendar period, to cooperate with us to verify usage and adherence to purchased Capacities. If Splunk requests a verification process, you agree to provide Splunk reasonable access to the On-Premises Product installed at your facility (or as hosted by your Third-Party Provider). If Splunk does any verification, it will be performed with as little interference as possible to your use of the On-Premises Product and your business operations. Splunk will comply with your (or your Third-Party Providers’) reasonable security procedures.

B. **Overages.** If a verification or usage report reveals that you have exceeded the purchased Capacity or usage rights for your Purchased Offering (e.g., used as a service bureau) during the period reviewed, then we will have the right to invoice you using the applicable Fees at list price then in effect, which will be payable in accordance with these General Terms. Without limiting Splunk’s foregoing rights, with respect to Hosted Services, Splunk may work with you to reduce usage so that it conforms to the applicable usage limit, and we will in good faith discuss options to right size your subscription as appropriate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Splunk will have the right to directly invoice you for overages, regardless of whether you purchased the Purchased Offering from an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace. See the Specific Offering Terms for any additional information related to overages for a Hosted Service.

#### **13. Our Use of Open Source**

Certain Offerings may contain Open Source Software. Splunk makes available in the applicable Documentation a list of Open Source Software incorporated in our On-Premises Products as required by the respective Open Source Software licenses. Any Open Source Software that is delivered as part of your Offering and which may not be removed or used separately from the Offering is covered by the warranty, support and indemnification provisions applicable to the Offering. Some of the Open Source Software may have additional terms that apply to the use of the Offering (e.g., the obligation for us to provide attribution of the specific licensor), and those terms will be included in the Documentation; however, these terms will not (a) impose any additional restrictions on your use of the Offering, or (b) negate or amend any of our responsibilities with respect to the Offering.

#### **14. Splunk Developer Tools and Customer Extensions**

Splunk makes Splunk Developer Tools available to you so you can develop Extensions for use with your Purchased Offerings (Extensions that you develop, &quot;**Customer Extensions**&quot;).

You have a nonexclusive, worldwide, nontransferable, nonsublicensable right, subject to the terms of these General Terms, to use Splunk Developer Tools to develop your Customer Extensions, including to support interoperability between the Offering and your system or environment. Splunk proprietary legends or notices contained in the Splunk Developer Tools may not be removed or altered when used in or with your Customer Extension. You retain title to your Customer Extensions, subject to Splunk’s ownership in our Offerings and any materials and technology provided by Splunk in connection with the Splunk Developer Tools. You agree to assume full responsibility for the performance and distribution of Customer Extensions.

#### **15. Third Party Products, Third-Party Extensions, Third-Party Content and Unsupported Splunk Extensions**

A. **Third-Party Extensions on Splunkbase.** Splunk makes Extensions developed and/or made available by a third-party on Splunkbase (&quot;**Third-Party Extension**&quot;) available for download or access as a convenience to its customers. Splunk makes no promises or guarantees related to any Third-Party Extension, including the accuracy, integrity, quality, or security of the Third-Party Extension. Nothing in these General Terms or on Splunkbase will be deemed to be a representation or warranty by Splunk with respect to any Third-Party Extension, even if a particular Third-Party Extension is identified as &quot;certified&quot; or &quot;validated&quot; for use with an Offering. We may, in our reasonable discretion, block or disable access to any Third-Party Extension at any time. Your use of a Third-Party Extension is at your own risk and may be subject to any additional terms, conditions, and policies applicable to that Third-Party Extension (such as license terms, terms of service, or privacy policies of the providers of such Third-Party Extension). Third-Party Extensions may be installed on Hosted Services pursuant to our instructions.

B. **Third Party Content.** Hosted Services may contain features or functions that enable interoperation with Third-Party Content that you, in your sole discretion, choose to add to a Hosted Service. You may be required to obtain access separately to such Third-Party Content from the respective providers, and you may be required to grant Splunk access to your accounts with such providers to the extent necessary for Splunk to allow the interoperation with the Hosted Service. By requesting or allowing Splunk to enable access to such Third-Party Content in connection with the Hosted Services, you certify that you are authorized under the provider’s terms to allow such access. If you install or enable (or direct or otherwise authorize Splunk to install or enable) Third-Party Content for use with a Hosted Service where the interoperation includes access by the third-party provider to your Customer Content, you hereby authorize Splunk to allow the provider of such Third-Party Content to access Customer Content as necessary for the interoperation. You agree that Splunk is not responsible or liable for disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Content resulting from access to Customer Content by such Third-Party Content, nor is Splunk liable for any damages or downtime that you may incur or any impact on your experience of the Hosted Service, directly or indirectly, as a result of your use of and/or reliance upon, any Third-Party Content, sites or resources.

C. **Splunk As a Reseller.** When you purchase third party products (&quot;**Third Party Products**&quot;) from Splunk as specified in an Order (which products shall include third party software, but not any support which Splunk itself has contracted to provide), the following provision applies. Splunk acts solely as a reseller of Third Party Products, which are fulfilled by the relevant third party vendor (&quot;**Third Party Vendor**&quot;), and the purchase and use of Third Party Products is subject solely to the terms, conditions and policies made available by such Third Party Vendor. Consequently, Splunk makes no representation or warranty of any kind regarding the Third Party Products, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, and specifically disclaims all implied terms, conditions and warranties (including as to quality, performance, availability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. You will bring any claim in relation to Third Party Products against the applicable Third Party Vendor directly. In no event will Splunk be liable to you for any claim, loss or damage arising out of the use, operation or availability of Third Party Product (whether such liability arises in contract, negligence, tort, or otherwise).

D. **Unsupported Splunk Extensions.** The Service Level Schedule commitments for any applicable Hosted Services will not apply to Splunk Extensions labeled on Splunkbase as &quot;**Not Supported.**&quot; You agree that Splunk is not responsible for any impact on your experience of a Hosted Service, as a result of your installation and/or use of any &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extensions, and that your sole remedy will be to remove the &quot;Not Supported&quot; Splunk Extension from the applicable Hosted Service. Further, some Splunk Extensions may not be compatible or certified for use with that Hosted Service (e.g., only specific Splunk Extensions are validated for our FedRAMP authorized environment for Splunk Cloud Platform). Please refer to the applicable Documentation for more information related to the Splunk Extensions compatible with your specific Purchased Offering.

#### **16. Your Compliance**

A. **Lawful Use of Offerings.** When you access and use an Offering, you are responsible for complying with all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to your access and use. This includes being responsible for your Customer Content and users, for your users’ compliance with these General Terms, and the accuracy, lawful use of, and the means by which you acquired your Customer Content. You may not transmit and/or store PHI Data, PCI Data or ITAR Data within a Hosted Services unless you have specifically purchased a Purchased Offering for that applicable regulated Hosted Services environment (as identified in an Order).

B. **Registration.** You agree to provide accurate and complete information when you register for and use any Offering and agree to keep this information current. Each person who uses any Offering must have a separate username and password. For Hosted Services, you must provide a valid email address for each person authorized to use your Hosted Services, and you may only have one person per username and password. Splunk may reasonably require additional information in connection with certain Offerings (e.g., technical information necessary for your connection to a Hosted Service), and you will provide this information as reasonably requested by Splunk. You are responsible for securing, protecting, and maintaining the confidentiality of your account usernames, passwords and access tokens.

C. **Export Compliance.** You will comply with all applicable export laws and regulations of the United States and any other country (&quot;Export Laws&quot;) where your users use any of the Offerings. You certify that you are not on any of the relevant U.S. government lists of prohibited persons, including the Treasury Department’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and the Commerce Department’s List of Denied Persons or Entity List. You will not export, re-export, ship, transfer or otherwise use the Offerings in any country subject to an embargo or other sanction by the United States, including, without limitation, Iran, Syria, Cuba, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, Sudan and North Korea, and you will not use any Offering for any purpose prohibited by the Export Laws.

D. **GovCloud Services.** If you access or use any Hosted Services in the specially isolated Amazon Web Services (&quot;**AWS**&quot;) GovCloud (US) region (including without limitation any Hosted Services that are provisioned in a FedRAMP authorized environment within the AWS GovCloud (US) region)), you hereby represent and warrant that: (i) you are a &quot;US Person&quot; as defined under ITAR (see 22 CFR part 120.62); (ii) you have and will maintain a valid Directorate of Defense Trade Controls registration, if required by ITAR; (iii) you and your end users are not subject to export control restrictions under US export control laws and regulations (i.e., users are not denied or debarred parties or otherwise subject to sanctions); (iv) you will maintain an effective compliance program to ensure compliance with applicable US export control laws and regulations, including ITAR, as applicable; and (v) you will maintain effective access controls as described in the Specific Offering Terms for the applicable Hosted Services. You are responsible for verifying that any user accessing Customer Content in the Hosted Services in the AWS GovCloud (US) region is eligible to access such Customer Content. The Hosted Services in the AWS GovCloud (US) region may not be used to process or store classified data. You will be responsible for all sanitization costs incurred by Splunk if users introduce classified data into the Hosted Services in the AWS GovCloud (US) region. You may be required to execute additional addendums to this agreement prior to provisioning of selected Hosted Services.

E. **Acceptable Use.** Without limiting any terms under these General Terms, you will also abide by our Hosted Services acceptable use policy: https://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAMB6.

#### **17. Confidentiality**

A. **Confidential Information.** Each party will protect the Confidential Information of the other. Accordingly, Receiving Party agrees to: (i) protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information using the same degree of care (but in no event less than reasonable care) that it uses to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature; (ii) limit use of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information for purposes consistent with these General Terms, and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to limit access to Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to its employees, contractors and agents or those of its Affiliates who have a bona fide need to access such Confidential Information for purposes consistent with these General Terms and who are subject to confidentiality obligations no less stringent than those herein.

B. **Compelled Disclosure of Confidential Information.** Notwithstanding the foregoing terms, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is compelled by law enforcement agencies or regulators to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a Party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to such Confidential Information.

#### **18. Payment**

The payment terms below only apply when you purchase Offerings directly from Splunk. When you purchase from an authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace, the payment terms are between you and the authorized reseller or Digital Marketplace. However, a breach of your payment obligations for an Offering with a Digital Marketplace will be deemed a breach of this Section 18.

A. **Fees.** You agree to pay all Fees specified in the Orders. Fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except as otherwise expressly set forth in these General Terms. Without limiting any of our other rights or remedies herein, overdue charges may accrue interest monthly at the rate of 1.5% of the then-outstanding unpaid balance, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower. Fees are due and payable either within 30 days from the date of Splunk’s invoice or as otherwise stated in the Order.

B. **Credit Cards.** If you pay by credit, or debit card you: (i) will provide Splunk or its designated third-party payment processor with valid credit or debit card information; and (ii) hereby authorize Splunk or its designated third-party payment processor to charge such credit or debit card for all items listed in the applicable Order. Such charges must be paid in advance or in accordance with any different billing frequency stated in the applicable Order.

#### **21. Term and Termination**

A. **Term and Renewal.** These General Terms will commence upon the Effective Date and will remain in effect until the expiration of all applicable Purchased Offerings, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Section. Termination of a specific Purchased Offering will not affect the Term of any other Purchased Offering. Termination of these General Terms will have the effect of terminating all Purchased Offerings. Grounds for terminating a Purchased Offering (e.g., for non-payment), that are specific to the Purchased Offering, will not be grounds to terminate Purchased Offerings where no breach exists. Unless indicated otherwise in an Order, the Term of a Purchased Offering (and these General Terms) will automatically renew for an additional period of time equal to the length of the preceding Term, unless one party notifies the other of its intent not to renew at least one (1) day in advance of the expiration of the Term or then-current renewal period.

B. **Termination.** Either party may terminate these General Terms, or any Purchased Offering, by written notice to the other party in the event of a material breach of these General Terms, or the specific terms associated with that Purchased Offering, that is not cured within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice.

Notwithstanding any early termination above, except for your termination for our uncured material breach, you will still be required to pay all Fees payable under an Order.

C. **Survival.** The termination or expiration of these General Terms will not affect any provisions herein which by their nature survive termination or expiration, including the provisions that deal with the following subject matters: definitions, ownership of intellectual property, confidentiality, payment obligations, effect of termination, limitation of liability, privacy, and the &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; section in these General Terms.

D. **Suspension of Service.** In the event of a material breach or threatened material breach of this Agreement, Splunk may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, suspend your use of the Hosted Service until such breach is cured or Splunk reasonably believes there is no longer a threat, provided that, we will give you at least five (5) days’ prior notice before suspension. Suspension of a Hosted Service will have no impact on the duration of the Term of the Purchased Offering, or the associated Fees owed.

#### **22. Limitation of Liability**

**In no event will the aggregate liability of either party, together with any of its Affiliates, arising out of or related to any Purchased Offering exceed the total amount paid by you for that Purchased Offering in the twelve (12) months preceding the first incident out of which the liability arose. However, the foregoing limitation will not limit your obligations under the &quot;Payment&quot; section above and will not be deemed to limit your rights to any service level credits under any applicable Service Level Schedule. Furthermore, the cap above will not be deemed to limit Splunk’s right to recover amounts for your use of an Offering in excess of the Capacity purchased or use outside of Internal Business Purposes.**

**In no event will either party or its Affiliates have any liability arising out of or related to these General Terms for any lost profits, revenues, goodwill, or indirect, special, incidental, consequential, cover, business interruption or punitive damages.**

**The foregoing limitations will apply whether the action is in contract or tort and regardless of the theory of liability, even if a party or its Affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages or if a party’s or its Affiliates’ remedy otherwise fails of its essential purpose.**

**The limitation of liability herein will not apply to a party’s infringement of the other party’s intellectual property rights, indemnification obligations, or the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of a party.**

**The foregoing disclaimers of damages will also not apply to the extent prohibited by law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. To the extent such a law applies to you, some or all of the exclusions or limitations set forth above may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights.**

#### **23. Indemnity**

A. **Our Indemnification to You.** Splunk will defend and indemnify you, and pay all damages (including attorneys’ fees and costs) awarded against you, or that are agreed to in a settlement, to the extent a claim, demand, suit or proceeding is made or brought against you or your Affiliates by a third party (including those brought by a government entity) alleging that a Purchased Offering infringes or misappropriates such third party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (a &quot;**Customer Claim**&quot;).

C. **Mutual Indemnity.** Each party will defend, indemnify and pay all damages (including attorneys’ fees and costs) awarded against the other party, or that are agreed to in a settlement to the extent that an action brought against the other party by a third party is based upon a claim for bodily injury (including death) to any person, or damage to tangible property resulting from the negligent acts or willful misconduct of the indemnifying party or its personnel hereunder, and will pay any reasonable, direct, out-of-pocket costs, damages and reasonable attorneys’ fees attributable to such claim that are awarded against the indemnified party (or are payable in settlement by the indemnified party).

D. **Process for Indemnification.** The indemnification obligations above are subject to the party seeking indemnification to: (i) provide the other party with prompt written notice of the specific claim; (ii) give the indemnifying party sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim (except that the indemnifying party may not settle any claim that requires any action or forbearance on the indemnified party’s part without their prior consent, which will not unreasonably withhold or delay); and (iii) gives the indemnifying party all reasonable assistance, at such party’s expense.

    B. **Personnel Conduct.** Our Personnel are subject to our Splunk Code of Conduct and Ethics [here](https://investors.splunk.com/static-files/3c2a9a40-7f6e-4795-9358-b5565826b13d?_ga=2.200727335.82146825.1675981089-269939538.1673288458&_gac=1.188710106.1674005341.Cj0KCQiAq5meBhCyARIsAJrtdr75-RptXmmxNnKzoOJ_p26uX0MwT-GzxcrmWSotrQqWFlaOLtYVyhgaAuriEALw_wcB&_gl=1*1m2mlyb*_ga*MjY5OTM5NTM4LjE2NzMyODg0NTg.*_ga_5EPM2P39FV*MTY3NjA1MTkwNi40OC4xLjE2NzYwNjAxMzMuMzYuMC4w), which includes, without limitation, an obligation to comply with our policies on protecting customer information, prohibitions on illegal drugs and any impaired job performance, avoiding conflicts of interest, and acting ethically at all times. We also background check our employees, per the Section below.

    C. **Use of Subcontractors.** We reserve the right to use subcontractors in performance of the C&I Services, provided: (a) any subcontractor we use meets the requirements herein and conditions of these General Terms and the Statement of Work; (b) we will be responsible for the subcontractor’s compliance with the terms herein and the Statement of Work; and (c) upon your request or inquiry, we will identify any subcontractor that we are using, or plan to use, for C&I Services, and will cooperate in good faith to provide you with all relevant information regarding such subcontractors.

    D. **No Employee Benefits.** We acknowledge and agree that our Personnel are not eligible for or entitled to receive any compensation, benefits, or other incidents of employment that you make available to your employees. We are solely responsible for all employment related taxes, expenses, withholdings, and other similar statutory obligations arising out of the relationship between us and our Personnel and the performance of C&I Services by such Personnel.

3. **Our Background Checks, Security and Compliance Obligations**

    A. **Compliance with Your Security Program.** While on your premises, our Personnel will comply with your security practices and procedures generally prescribed by you for onsite visitors and service providers. However, any requirement that is in addition to the compliance requirements set forth in this Schedule (e.g., background checks that are different from the background checks described herein) must be expressly set forth in a Statement of Work. We agree to discuss in good faith any condition or requirement you may have for our Personnel that are different from standard policies, however any additional requirement may delay C&I Services and must be vetted and implemented by mutual agreement of the parties and expressly set forth in a Statement of Work. Splunk does not guarantee that it will be able to meet any additional requested requirements.

    B. **Our Security Practices.** We implement and follow an enterprise security program, with the policies, plans, and procedures set forth here [www.splunk.com/prof-serv-isa](www.splunk.com/prof-serv-isa). Our Personnel will be subject to the data protection and confidentiality obligations set forth in these General Terms with respect to any of your data that we may have access to in connection with the C&I Services.

    C. **Background Checks.** For U.S.-based projects, we will not assign an employee to perform C&I Services under a Statement of Work unless we have run the following background check on the employee: Criminal Felony & Misdemeanor; SSN Validation; Federal Criminal; SSN Trace; Employment Report – Three (3) Employers; Education Report – One (1) Institution; Global Sanctions & Enforcement; Prohibited Parties; Widescreen Plus National Criminal Search.

    D. **Permissions for Access.** In the event you require any Personnel to sign any waivers, releases, or other documents as a condition to gain access to your premises for performance of the C&I Services (&quot;**Access Documents**&quot;), you agree: (a) that Personnel who will be required to sign Access Documents will sign on behalf of Splunk; (b) that any additional or conflicting terms in Access Documents with these General Terms will have no effect; and (c) you will pursue any claims for breach of any terms in the Access Documents against Splunk and not the individual signing.

4. **Your Materials**

    We will have no rights in or to any Customer Materials, however you grant us the right to use Customer Materials in order to provide the C&I Services. Nothing in these General Terms will deemed to transfer to us any ownership of Customer Materials.

5. **C&I Services Materials and Customizations Unique to You**

    A. **C&I Services Materials.** The C&I Services we perform (e.g., configuration of our Offerings), and the C&I Services Materials we offer, create, and deliver to you in connection with the C&I Services, are generally applicable to our business, and therefore we require the right to be able to re-use the C&I Services Materials we create for one customer in connection with all of our customers. For the avoidance of doubt, our use of the C&I Services Materials created for you in connection with C&I Services will comply with our ongoing obligations and restrictions with respect to your Customer Materials and your Confidential Information, and we will not identify you in any way in connection with our further use of such C&I Services Materials.

    B. **Customer Owned Work Product.** However, in the unlikely event that the parties agree that C&I Services Materials for a project are custom work product unique to your business, and not applicable to other customers generally, we will transfer ownership to those agreed C&I Services Materials to you under the applicable Statement of Work. C&I Services Materials must be expressly identified as &quot;**Customer Owned Work Product**&quot; under a Statement of Work for ownership to pass to you. Subject to payment of applicable Fees under the Statement of Work, we hereby assign to you all rights, title and interest (including all Intellectual Property Rights therein) in and to all C&I Services Materials identified as Customer Owned Work Product (but excluding all Splunk Preexisting IP incorporated into the Customer Owned Work Product). At your request and expense, we will assist and cooperate with you in all reasonable respects and will execute documents and take such further acts reasonably requested by you to enable you to acquire, transfer, maintain, perfect, and enforce your ownership rights in such Customer Owned Work Product.

    C. **Our Ownership.** Subject to your ownership rights in Customer Owned Work Product and Customer Materials, we will own all rights in and to all C&I Services Materials.

    D. **License Rights.** For those C&I Services Materials that are not Customer Owned Work Product, you will have the right to access and use those C&I Services Materials in connection with your applicable Offerings, and those rights will be of the same scope and duration as your rights to the underlying Offering.

6. **C&I Services Warranty**

    We warrant that the C&I Services will be performed in a good and workmanlike manner consistent with applicable industry standards. This warranty will be in effect for a period of thirty (30) days from the completion of any C&I Services. As your sole and exclusive remedy and our entire liability for any breach of the foregoing warranty, we will, at our option and expense, promptly re-perform any C&I Services that fail to meet this warranty or refund to you the fees paid for the non-conforming C&I Services.

7. **Your Cooperation**

    You acknowledge that your timely provision of (and our access to) your facilities, equipment, assistance, cooperation, data, information and materials from your officers, agents, and employees (the &quot;**Cooperation**&quot;) is essential to Splunk’s performance of the C&I Services. We will not be liable for any delay or deficiency in performing the C&I Services if you do not provide the necessary Cooperation. As part of the Cooperation, you will (1) designate a project manager or technical lead to liaise with us while we perform the C&I Services; (2) allocate and engage additional resources as may be required to assist us in performing the C&I Services; and (3) making available to us any data, information and any other materials reasonably required by us to perform the C&I Services, including any data, information or materials specifically identified in the Statement of Work.

8. **Insurance**

    Throughout any period of C&I Services we perform for you, we will maintain insurance policies in the types and amounts described below at our own expense:

    - Commercial General Liability Insurance with a limit of not less than $1,000,000 per occurrence and a general aggregate limit of not less than $2,000,000.

    - Business Auto Insurance with a limit of not less than $1,000,000 combined single limit. Such Insurance will cover liability arising out of &quot;hired and non-owned&quot; automobiles.

    - Worker’s Compensation Insurance as required by workers’ compensation, occupational disease and occupational health and safety laws, statutes, and regulations.

    - Technology Errors & Omissions Insurance with a limit of not less than $3,000,000 per occurrence and general aggregate.

    - Umbrella/Excess Insurance with a limit of not less than $3,000,000 per occurrence and general aggregate.

9. **Change Order Process**

    You may submit written requests to us to change the scope of C&I Services described in a Statement of Work (each such request, a &quot;**Change Order Request**&quot;). If we elect to consider a Change Order Request, then we will promptly notify you if we believe that the Change Order Request requires an adjustment to the fees or to the schedule for the performance of the C&I Services. In such event, the parties will negotiate in good faith a reasonable and equitable adjustment to the fees and/or schedule, as applicable. We will continue to perform C&I Services pursuant to the existing Statement of Work and will have no obligation to perform any Change Order Request unless and until the parties have agreed in writing to such an equitable adjustment.

10. **Expenses**

    Unless otherwise specified in the Statement of Work, we will not charge you for our expenses we incur in connection with a Statement of Work. Our daily C&I Services rates are inclusive of any expenses. In the event the parties agree that expenses are reimbursable under a Statement of Work, we will mutually agree on any travel policy and any required documentation for reimbursement.

11. **Prepaid C&I Services**

    Unless otherwise expressly stated in a Statement of Work, all prepaid C&I Services must be redeemed within twelve (12) months from the date of purchase/invoice. At the end of the twelve (12) month term, any remaining pre-paid unused C&I Services will expire; no refunds will be provided for any remaining pre-paid unused C&I Services. Unless otherwise specifically stated in a Statement of Work, Education is invoiced and payable in advance.

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

2. License Grants and Conditions

2.1. Grants

     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
     non-exclusive license:

     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as
        part of a Larger Work; and

     b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
        sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions
        or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
     such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
        Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

      This Source Code Form is subject to the
      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.
      2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not
      distributed with this file, You can
      obtain one at
      http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant
directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice

      This Source Code Form is “Incompatible
      With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by
      the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.
